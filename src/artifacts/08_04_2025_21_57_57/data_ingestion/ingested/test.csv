ham,"Subject: new version of stack manager
introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager ."

subject : gorons
don ' t know who you ' re voting for , but here some things you might want to
consider -
what is a goron
1 . gorons sincerely believe that vice president gore is a true
environmentalist , when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm :
a polluting zinc mine , from which he received $ 500 , 000 of income last
year .
2 . gorons likewise believe that the vp is antismoking and anti - tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies .
3 . gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact
he was placed by family influence in a "" cushy "" correspondent ' s job and
the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera ! ( and his bong )
4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the
vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .
5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums
of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .
6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "" invent the
internet "" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially incriminating e - mail !
7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were
the models for the book and movie , "" love story "" even though the book ' s
author , erich segal , says not .
8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s
champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million
dollars in occidental petroleum stock .
9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president
clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain
silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton "" one of
the greatest presidents of our history . ""
10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they
won ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so
ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of
tennessee ' s senators !
11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum house that he was renting to them .
cautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are
generally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there ,
unfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to
actually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their
ailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and
that of the usa .
therefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to
aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to
your normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate
treatment ."

from : celestedeo @ aol . com
sent : tuesday , april 11 , 2000 1 : 21 pm
subject : special prayer request
hi ,
i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some good
friends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year old
baby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark was
diagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . he
also has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .
if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live to
july . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at the
anderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows of
a
strong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( when
possible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if a
donor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .
it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers and
i
know if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .
if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every little
prayer they get will be appreciated .
thank you !

be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no
later than mar . 24 , 2000 . this team is effective as of tomorrow , mar . 16 ,
2000 at 9 : 00 a . m .

i updated the june transport usage tickets today through hpl , and will be
finishing these tickets tomorrow . rates have been updated to reflect current
matrix rates and all baseload rates that i know of at this time . i have not
yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let
me know . also , i have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june , so
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you
have any questions . all pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning .

rick ,
bob hall , daren farmer and i met on thursday regarding the fee - - i have a very
rough draft done and my plan is to revise and edit today and tomorrow .
however , i spoke with dan lyons yesterday regarding some issues with the
supply contracts that concerned me and he agrees that we need to look into
them further . in addition , bob hall , daren and i thought we might could use a
brief tutorial on the structure of the transaction generally , the parties
involved and their correct legal names and their relationship to enron . dan
lyons has volunteered to give us that tutorial but will not be available
until early next week when he and i will meet to discuss the supply contract
issues as well . call me if you have any questions - -

i thought it might be helpful to summarize the next steps we agreed are
necessary to put a "" gas agency "" agreement in place between the texas desk and
ponderosa pine energy , llc .
mazowita and farmer to work with plant manager ( mike gough ) to determine :
how power schedules are received from brazos and translated into fuel
requirements
the plant ' s operating flexibility to use fuel oil over natural gas
how the use of fuel oil is built into the dispatch / operation decision
the degree to which the plant has historically been involved with fuel
suppliers beyond tgc ( i . e . , apache , williams , lone star )
mazowita and farmer to work with tgc ( nancy stivers ) to determine :
how gas schedules are received from the plant
why there were structural differences between the apache / williams fuel supply
agreements and the tgc agency agreement
tgc ' s experience with optimizing value under the fuel supply agreements
farmer to determine if a "" form agreement "" is available within ena for
transactions of this nature
lyons / hill to determine ( a ) if there is a need to have the gas agency
agreement at the project vs . holding company level and ( b ) if bank approvals
are needed as a result of the new agreement
lyons / mazowita / farmer to draft agency agreement
griffith to determine the best means of handling "" duel fuel "" capability at
the plant within ena
as an aside , i passed the information that daren gave me in the meeting
concerning the tax certificate for the use of fuel oil on to rhett jackson ,
who handled tax - related matters during the acquisition phase of this

i ' m not sure if you can help me , but i have a danny conner deal from december 2000 that has a price issue .
we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

rick ,
just following up my voicemail to you yesterday - - - john griffith has
contacted me regarding the gas management agreement relating to the
cornhusker transaction . when dan was in my office several weeks ago , we spoke
with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas
management agreement were yet to be worked out - - has that occurred yet ? do you
know the details of the extension on the transition agreement ? are you
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you
think should be included ? ( john griffith has asked to be included and
suggests darren farmer and bob hall be present as well ) - - please let me know
thank you ,

texas a & m football practice was delayed on monday for nearly two hours at kyle field . one of the players , while on his way to the locker room happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking , unknown white powdery substance on the practice field .
head coach r . c . slocum immediately suspended practice while the fbi was called in to investigate . after a complete field analysis , the fbi determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line .
practice was resumed when fbi special agents decided that the team would not be likely to encounter the substance again ."

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

from : mr . richard mayer
dear friend ,
i am mr . richard mayer , the accountant general of nedbank of south
africa . i request your co - operation in the transfer of money amounting to
u . s . d . 32 million .
on september 2001 , an american pilot , mr . roy kenob , an american ational
made a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on
maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno
reply . after a month , i sent a reminder and finally his employers
wrote to inform us that mr . kenob died in a plane crash , that he died without
making a will while our attempt to trace his next of kin through american
embassy proved fruitless .
when he was making deposition in my bank , he did not declare his next of
kin in his deposit application form , when i reminded him he said he
wished it so , in the conservative manner of our bank , i did not turn down
his request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is
that his employer are not aware of his deposit with us , therefore i am the
only person who know about mr . roy ' s deposit of u . s . d 32 , 000 , 000 . 00 which
is now lying in dormant account portfolio , the whole account relating to
mr . kenob ' s deposit is also with me .
i am looking forward for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of
kin to mr . roy . i have worked out modalities of achieving my aim by
appointing you as the next of kin to mr . roy as well as transfer the u . s . d
32 , 000 , 000 . 00 abroad for us to share . i will use an attorney who will represent
you as the beneficiary to execute series a written will and attestament
of late mr . roy kenob , in support of your claim including certificate of
origin of the money , letter of probate which empowers you as the sole trustee / executor
to the estate of mr . roy kenob . please note that you will not be required
to sign any transfer document , as the appointed attorney will do all
that .
if you agree to act as the next of kin / beneficiary to enable me
transfer / convert the money to our own benefit / use . i will give you 30 % of
usd 32 m , 60 % will be for me while 10 % will be to take care of all unforeseen
expenses as we may incure in the course of concluding this transaction .
i am urgently waiting for your positive reply on the address below .
regards ,

and e - mails stating that some reclasses need to be made because you no longer
have an analyst in your group . the information used by financial operations
to charge your rc was obtained from the org database . please review the
attached files for january and february to ensure that the proper rc was and
is going to be charged . if you have any corrections , please contact brian
heinrich at ext . 5 - 7677 asap since journal entries will need to be processed
by this friday , march 3 rd .
if you have any questions , please call me . i just want to let everyone know

subject : monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

spam,"Subject: cheap soft cialis tabs
these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .
thank you for your time . please let me know if you have any questions , comments , suggestions .

assure that new transactions ( a ) incorporate appropriate risk / return
characteristics , ( b ) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing
signals , and ( c ) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes
syndication of the investment , if applicable , and a specific exit strategy .
portfolio management includes restructuring / special assets ( randy
maffett / dick lydecker ) and capital structuring ( andrea reed ) . steve pruett
( energy capital resources ) , chuck ward ( generation investments ) , don miller

spam,"Subject: microsoft plus x , p update
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

yes , you are correct . when we watchdog , we ' ll most likely do vm and settlements and not pm . but , in the afternoon , if they need payments out the door , pm will get it . it goes both ways . so , if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what , that would help .
you are correct , 8 - 12 is logistics critical , and after that it ' s anyones guess .

based on victor ' s response , i think there is some confusion . there are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day . perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog . i interpreted it to mean the 8 - 12 am period but victor was thinking the afternoon . depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out .

going forward , as a precautionary measure , we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises . we will use our watchdog application in order to initiate this process . we will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this . our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most .
the old list we had from sybase no longer exists . i need your help in putting together a new list . please provide the list of people who are absolutely critical users that have to be on the system . obviously , the situation isn ' t remedied if everyone is an exception user : )

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

subject : update on prc process
today was the final ena prc . relative ranking results up through the senior
director level are final . you and your management team can begin the process
of giving performance reviews to your employees . i spoke with sheila walton
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting
the employee reviews . she indicated that the target completion date should
be the end of july .
promotions will be effective august lst . it is dave delainey ' s intent to
announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 24 .
this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews . i do not
yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single
memo , or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo . i will keep you
updated on this as i get direction from him .
please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june . in
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid - year review
process , we will not share performance clusters with employees when
conducting their reviews . it is very important for all of us to be
consistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups
who will be giving performance reviews . it is important to note , however ,
that the content of an employee ' s review should be consistent with our view
of that employee ' s relative ranking . in other words , an employee in the
satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that
the employee is doing a great job . clearly , a large number of employees
performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory
category , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in
the organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .
also please note the following :
performance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory , needs improvement or
issues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given
to the employees . this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with
the relative performance of that employee . ( this has been the stated process
for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process
as well . )
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,
yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced
members of your management team , or those management team members where you
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and
perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time
in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow
through on this commitment .
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a
meaningful one .
it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0"

3 ) transco bammel meter 74 - transco and hpl ' s nominations are out of
balance at meter 74 . charlotte needs to work with transco to resolve .
4 ) dow meter 4486 - the sale to entex needs to be taken off of hplc meter

a desk to desk between ena ( buyer )

ami needs to set up the deals and
thu needs to coordinate the months involved .
once this is done and thu
reallocates to dow pipeline , jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and
make the meter non allocatable in pops .
clem verified with steve schneider
that this meter is not on hpl ' s system .
5 ) east texas gas / devon - devon invoicing ena entire flow at carthage .

3 - 5 times your money . . . would that interest you ?
it should , it ' s a lot better than bank interest .
and what if you could run this business on auto -
pilot and you didn ' t have to sponsor anyone , refer
anyone or enroll anyone to earn money . i ' d bet
you ' d like to know what it is right ?
plus , if you are a real go - getter and business
builder you could easily earn 10 - 40 times your
initial outlay .
now that ' s definitely nothing to sneeze at .
here ' s what you get . . . .
a company - wide matrix for massive spillover from
the team efforts of those above and below you !
your own personal matrix , to reap the rewards of
your personal sponsoring efforts !
it ' s the best of both worlds for maximum earning
power that puts cash in your pocket every day !
i ' m excited . this business puts cash in my pocket
daily and it can do the same for you .
want to know what it is ?

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

revision - according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however ,
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of 7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ? i checked
oss for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in oss . it does

i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

price was worked out with darren , i do not have record of it . darren is

like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick
walkthru / training of the new features sometime early next week . this should
only take about 30 minutes . once they are comfortable with the features and
performance , and once the testing is complete , we would like to migrate this
to unify production either next week or the week after . this should give us
an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week .
once it is migrated to production , we can either roll it out to all
schedulers or to selected schedulers via security .

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,
sincerely ,

technische universit?t m?nchen , germany : http : / / www . mpeg - 68 . de / location . php
the open workshop of musicnetwork is at its third edition . the modeling ofmusic
notation / representation is a complex problem . music representation can be used
for several different purposes : entertainment , music education , infotainment ,
music archiving and retrieval , music querying , music production , music profiling ,
etc . in the current internet and multimedia age many other applications are
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more diffuse
of the present applications in short time . end users have discovered the multimedia
experience , and thus , the traditional music models are going to be replaced by
their integration with multimedia , audio visual , cross media . at present , there is
a lack of music notation / representation standard integrated with multimedia . the
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music
notation / representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment ,
that presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of standard
formats for multimedia consumers .
the topics of the workshop are related mainly focused on :
- - music notation / representation requirements
- - music protection and distribution
- - music description and its usage on archive query
please contribute with your work on the above topics , for details see the www site
of the workshop .
the access is be free of charge , supported by the european commission .

it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .
thanks for you help in this matter .
please let me know of any concerns ."

hi all -
attached above is the master list of contracts we ' ll need for day 1 of newco . as the footnotes indicate , we ' ll also need new business party id ' s / passwords , an ebb agreement for all pipes and a tpa for each edi pipe ( tammy & i will be working on tpa ' s and ebb ' s ) . the timing indicated assumes that we have a clear newco structure , that the newco credit status has been identified , and that a duns number has been established . the two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines ' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through legal on each end , so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3 - 5 days even for pooling agreements . for the ldc ' s and intrastates , we ' ll need to specifically identify what each requires .
as we discussed , we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information :
pipeline contact name and number ( i know some of you sent me this b / f - - but pls make sure that it ' s the legal / regulatory contact , not your business counterpart )
credit requirements for a new entity with an "" a "" credit rating ( they may just refer you to the tariff , if so , pls . ask them for a specific site so we can do the research )
get a sense of the reaction of the pipe / ldc regarding credit for the new entity - - we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting .
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old enron bills , just reiterate that we ' re setting up a completely new entity and give them bob ' s , mine , or jeff hodge ' s name to discuss the estate issues .
if there are different requirements for different service levels ( ie , pooling vs . it vs . ft ) , pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe .
we need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level - - pls . ask the pipe / ldc to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it . once we have those together , i ' ll run the traps with legal .
it would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier , then work on the second .
i will be out of the office thursday & friday , but please call me on my cell phone at 713 - 516 - 2574 with any questions .
thanks ,

jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,

jay ,
if a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal ; therefore , we request the deals be zeroed out . call me if this is a problem . also , we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed .
in addition , i have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input .

ham,"Subject: tenaska iv agency fee
can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 .
my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further .

ham,"Subject: important information about united healthcare - please read !
to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that
may impact you or your family ."

wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might
involve your desks via eol in the near future . we already have one in the
east . i stressed to the sitara / eol folks the importance of adding comments
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is
happening . one side of these buy / sell or exchange deals will be ratable and
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the
counterparty desires .
i hope this helps . . . thanks !

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
the one communicating with the counterparty ) . we probably need eol to
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .
linda / karen - what are your thoughts on how separate gtc would work on this .
if we could all do a little homework . i will get something scheduled for
next week to discuss further .

subject : flexible physical us nat gas products on enrononline
we are positioning ourselves to release a new product type that we will refer
to as a flexible physical gas product . legal is in the process of drafting a
gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
party a buys 10 , 000 mmbtu per day ( or 300 , 000 total mmbtu ) at tco pool index
party b has the right to notify party a of when party b wants to take
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . ; if
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of
sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .
bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then
my turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
please feel free to call if you have any questions .

investor financial times report
specializing in undervalued small cap stocks for immediate breakout
erhc and exxon mobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after oil
blocks in nigeria and sao tome ' s joint development zone ( jdz ) in the
gulf of guinea .
every major news wire service worldwide has carried hundreds of articles
revealing that the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15
billion barrels of oil . the jdz line - up tipped to take over upcoming
blocks includes exxon mobil , erhc , chevron texaco , amerada hess ,
and anadarko .
license approval for the region ' s exclusive economic zone ( eez ) is a
multilateral deal securing blocks jointly involving exxon mobil , erhc ,
and chevron texaco .
erhc has jumped from a . 25 cent stock earlier in the year to a . 50 cent
stock that is headed for over $ 2 or a possible buyout from one of their
jdz multinational players .
erhc has been at the negotiating tables with the super - major oil
companies . it is impossible to measure the power that is carried where a
stock at this price level is a vital part of a key union of oil giants !
the top - level executives of the jdz oil majors have been finalizing the
percentage awards with erhc for official announcement of the
landmark - licensing round in the first 2 weeks of june .
the us government is pushing for increasing development of the area to
minimize middle east dependence . the eyes of the world are watching with
record prices at the pump and oil busting through $ 40 per barrel .
the oil companies will always make their $ billions - investors can cash
in by accumulating a substantial position just before earth - shattering
news is released that will send shock waves through erhc .

subject : resume for summer internship
april 20 , 2000
dear mr . mcconnell :
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron . i understand that you have spoken to my father , scott
wells at texaco , and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one .
i ' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer .
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry . i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler , and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline . this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points .
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning . throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor . it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron .
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility . i will be available to have a start date of
may 15 th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august .
thank you for your time , and i look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his / her earliest convenience . please feel free to call me at
940 - 323 - 0891 , or email me at rollins 50 @ aol . com .
sincerely -
sean wells

george -
in this afternoon ' s meeting with producer services , jill mentioned that the
referenced well had been reperfed ( meaning they shot more holes in the well
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well ) and was now producing
approximately 800 / day . per jill , the mdq on this well is 3000 / day . you may
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month .
mary - could you get heidi or lisa to check the transport rate we currently
show on this ? it ' s being purchased for sc - . 17 and is flowing through king
ranch .
thanks ."
ham,"Subject: enron announcement
car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .
if you have any questions or comments , please contact jeff leath at 713 - 646 - 6165 ."

ham,"Subject: re : fuel
application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a
total basis .

we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and

downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?"

subject : the osu game and aggie spirit
this just in ags ! if you are going to the osu game on sept 22 , a red , white
& blue out is being planned , just like the maroon out games for the osu
game .
ags , what better statement can we aggies make , than to celebrate the love
and support for our country ' s freedom , and our patriotic nature , than this
way :
imagine . . . the fightin ' texas aggie band playing "" the star spangled banner , ""
playing military drills as they walk around the stadium , and we celebrate
our love for our country , and our support for all the heroes , alive and
deceased . color assignments are as follows :
3 rd deck : red
2 nd deck : white lst deck : blue
pass the word on . . . . we have 1 1 / 2 weeks ! !
the spirit of america , and the aggie spirit is still alive . god bless
america , the free nation .
pass it on ."

i ' ve attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to unify for
november . please don ' t let this alarm you , this is how the bridge has always
worked . if you have questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
every instance i ' ve found looks okay because of the following :
* a transport ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* the deal didn ' t have a point assigned to it , only a zone

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

subject : re : equistar deal tickets
i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .

ham,"Subject: hpl optimization
team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .

i joined brian redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to sid richardson . during that visit sr indicated that they have firm lone star transport that they want to sell ( only details i know at this time is that it is 45 mm / d point to point on a true firm basis ) . i believe we could use this transport to back stop the falcon transaction ( parking gas in their facility oct / nov 01 - jan 04 ) . i spoke with the folks at sr today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally . they gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details . i understand you would be the right person to a ) . bounce this idea off of and b ) . if there is an interest on this transport i presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from sr .
the name of the person to talk to at sr is scott walker ( 817 . 810 . 9385 ) .

sorry , i can ' t remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what .
were you looking into this issue for me or was it passed to someone else .
please see the email below . i believe the system is pulling in the wrong
price for waha . wtx . if . m . i . . for 5 / 00 production . the deal # is 250237 .
i looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $ 2 . 95 .
the price of $ 2 . 95 plus $ 1 would equal the price of $ 2 . 96 which is what duke
is
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $ 3 . 95 .

are you confirming these volumes with hl & p ? we have been doing some special
deals at green ' s bayou and the hl & p dealmaker has been calling to find out
what the volumes are . i do not think he communicates with his scheduler , is
that the case ? anyway , we need to agree with hl & p on what volumes flowed on
these special days and get them into the system so they can be billed

ham,"Subject: pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

ham,"Subject: the houston expl dec 2000
daren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me , but i have a danny conner deal from december 2000 that has a price issue .
we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play "" capture the flag "" . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours .

ham,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

mitch :
a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not ) like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting point and if you like i can forward one for your review .
regards ,
brian"

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet ."

lauri , from a legal standpoint , we can cut the nomination on an
interruptible agreement at our discretion . the contract clearly gives us
this right . i haven ' t specifically reviewed the contract , but i am assuming
it is our standard form . i will check this .
yes , i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities . the fact that
this goes to entex first complicates the issue .
dan , was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities , or if
it ultimately ended up at state facilities ?

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

ham,"Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )
fred or anita ,
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121
is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the
gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !"

affiliates
ngi ' s daily gas price index
breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm
proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates
federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .
previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .
the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .
commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . "" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . ""
wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded .
wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

mr francis oma
attn : director / ceo ,
a cry for family help .
i am mr francis oma the first son of the late mr . peter oma . my father had served mr b . h . lions who was an irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village . my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death . my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe . he also became a successful businessman , because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing , my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence .
we left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $ 11 . 5 m ( eleven million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) and valuables ( diamonds ) worth us $ 5 m . my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival .
he also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition .
barely two months after we moved to johannesburg , we got information that my father ' s farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed . my father ' s property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans .
i believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms . we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives . our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund . have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer . your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum , 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i . the diamond will be discussed at our arrival .
we do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard . we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us , should this proposal meet your utmost consideration , please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address .
the confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands . please treat this proposal with the utmost regard , and the confidentiality of these business should not be over - emphasised .
please response on this email address ; francisoma @ zwallet . com
waiting for your favourable response .
thanks and god bless ,

lee ,
i did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu / day of
fuel
gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas . we will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days .

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .
thanks .

ham,"Subject: this week ' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up
good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

ham,"Subject: monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its
sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and
road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m
well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well
immediately there after .
the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban .
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and
gas has prepared a detailed project description .
project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and
has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil
and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .
the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major
oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely
eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the
deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in
the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more
specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .
through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres
( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %
of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in
5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .
land discussion
our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and
northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480
acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling
spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160
acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units
( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased
well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering
pekisko oil we will down space as well .
geological discussion
pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and
associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the
pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable
shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and
account for billions of barrels of reserves .
production facilities discussion
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed .
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed
drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is
approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,
excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of
red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get
oil product to the transportation system .
for more detailed project description please see news release dated
( fri , apr 29 ) .

ham,"Subject: opportunity on dow pipeline
darren , per our earlier conversation , here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the freeport area off of dow .
the potential customer ( don owen ) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years , buying supply from dow .
dow does not want to be a supplier in the future , but of course , will transport .
dow will quote only a 2 year transport ( $ 0 . 06 from katy to the plant ) , but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years .
other bids he is getting at index + . 03 / . 04 less whatever transport .
the swing load is approx . 1300 - 1350 mmbtu / d , but fairly steady he says .
let me know if you have any interest or if i should pass this along to someone else . thanks .
ps the customer will give more info if we are interested , but wanted to see if we have interest first ( and also if we had long term capacity on dow )"

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .
thanks .

hi daren ,
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .

sitara 147092 is tiered pricing . if you want , you can nom whatever volume is
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep
things in balance a bit better , but you can go either way . for feb there is a
base deal for 5000 / day and a term deal for 20 , 000 / day . only 15 , 000 of the
20000 is pathed ."

attract a fortune 50 o as a potential source of even greater , and as of
yet , untapped revenue . mcallister expects the deal to be consummated in

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

daren :
during the month of september and october 2000 , gas flowed into hpl ' s
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
marketing , llc . prior to september 2000 , the gas was purchased under
contract # 960439646 , and deal # 133196 that expired on 8 / 31 / 2000 . effective
11 / 1 / 2000 , the gas was again purchased from duke under contract # 96021934 ;
deal # 466305 , but this deal expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 .
currently , logistic has september and october 2000 volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract . in order to correct this , hpl logistics needs either
( 1 ) deals # 133196 or # 466305 extended to cover september and october 2000 ,
( 2 ) a new deal to cover september and october 2000 , or ( 3 ) logistics needs

or
approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
in addition , since deal # 466305 expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 and gas is still
flowing , logistics needs either ( 1 ) deal # 466305 extended , or ( 2 ) a new deal
to cover december 2000 and any other future months that this production is

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
needs . i am confused about praxair though .
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

the counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are :

markham gas
merit energy partners
praxair
reliant energy - entex
reliant energy - hl & p
southern union company
texas utilities fuel company ( now txu fuel co )

ena has transacted with the other companies listed below , but that will most
likely not happen again . ( hpl will trade with those counterparties . )
all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara . we have reports which can be
generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena . let me

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

miliennium earlier became the titie sponsor of the match point , inc .

acquisition negotiations .
both local delray beach - based companies could integrate the two
entities . basica | | y we ' re both from the same industry , and together i believe

said robert mcaliister , ceo president of mi | | ennium national events .

we are considering miliennium ' s offers and believe that there could be

both miilennium sharehoiders and match point . this acquisition is
consistent with our overa | | business pian . it has aiways been our intent to

we ' ve had our eye on match point for almost one year now . consolidation
is the key , not only to our bottom line , but also to the success of
each individua | event .
exact terms have been not yet been announced , but miliennium sees the
match point acquisition ultimately being abie to bring net revenues to
mnei ' s bottom | ine .
mnei sees both the internationa | teievision audience and the abiiity to
attract a fortune 5 oo as a potentia | source of even greater , and as of
yet , untapped revenue . mcaliister expects the dea | to be consummated in
this quarter .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

the only valid "" buyback "" ticket for meter # : 1373 is sitara ticket # :
246408 . s . ticket # : 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up
buyback
ticket across equistar ' s meters { 1552 , 1384 , 1062 , 1553 } . if you recall
this process was done to enable client services to automate equistar
allocation / billing . the project took place around april 2000
production retroactive back to jan . 1999 . the link to compute the buyback is
set up
on s . ticket # 246408 .
since equistar has begun doing business via ena , it was necessary to
establish a "" buyback ticket "" on ena ' s matrix .
thus , to answer your question , yes there should only be one "" buyback
ticket "" for meter # : 1373 on hpl and ena .
ena activity is kept whole and the swing is on hpl .

market watch news flash
explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many
significant news releases indicate strong contractual
revenues with major telecom firms .
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands
for their innovative patented products and expansion into
international telecom markets .
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior
patented outside plant electrical surge protection
equipment for the telecommunications industry .
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate
the industry .
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest
quality protection element for complex digital switches .
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .
major telecoms require this protection throughout their
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive
system failures .

how many times have you seen issues explode but you
couldn ' t get your hands on them or didn ' t have the right
information in time ? we are alerting you now to a special
company with a unique technology that is on the forefront
of a breakout ! we are excited about srge ' s technology
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases
in revenue for 2004 and 2005 . srge has made phenomenal
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued ,
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative .

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .
