spam,"Subject: this was the one recommended to me
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

went to you , or your office .
i would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the n . padre production . i am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter . spinnaker expects a division order title opining within a few
weeks . i also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final opinion . in talking with ranger and the houston
exploration company , they are prepared to receive their gross ( shown below )
and be responsible to their respective orri owners .
how do you recommend we proceed ? will hpl pay taxes on behalf of the

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

where were you when the following stocks exploded :
scos : exploded from . 39 on september 1 to 1 . 41 close on october 14 .
sior : september lst close of . 24 . blew through the roof as it
passed . 80 on friday .
face it . little stocks can mean big gains for you . this report is
part of a large pr campaign on this stock .
about the company :
the primary objective of hpng is to participate in specialty finance
within the public and private markets . hampden has partnerships
with finance and in surance companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short - term financing .
hampden is a unique finance company that uses new technologies to
help track and protect loan portfolio assets . the use of
sophisticated tracking technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and allows the company to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments . in addition to physical
asset backed lending , hampden grp . will also actively participate
in structured financial contracts with small public companies
through pipe ( private investment public entity ) transactions .
hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short - term working capital and cannot obtain
traditional financing .
hampden ' s business plan provides collateralized financing to
its customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25 % . the
company ' s valuation , financial ratios , executive compensation , exit
strategy , and other management decisions are driven directly from
the business plan . ( source : news announcement 10 / 15 / 04 )
will hpng explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until it is too
late . remember , timing your trade is critical . good luck and happy
trading .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

hello again ,

know your comments .
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .

ham,"Subject: change of control provisions
as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .
thank you ."

these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .

would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .

reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .

ham,"Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm

global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let
me what you think .

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

ham,"Subject: important information about united healthcare - please read !
to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,
sincerely ,

daren ,
i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example # 1 .
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .
i have attached my spreadsheet for support :
the most current worksheet is tab # 2 marked final
column g is the over - delivery quantity total is 17 , 278 mmbtus
column s is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due hplc
$ 1 , 008 . 87
column t is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due the
customer $ 519 . 73 .

katherine ,
there are 2 ways that i can enter this fee into sitara :
1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i
can ' t just input a dollar amount in sitara .
let me know how you want to handle it .

subject : beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000
ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .
please call with questions .
thanks

less of it . by the time we are forty nearly everyone is deficient in hgh ,

i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with
hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,
can hpl sever the point some other way ?
someone let me hear what you think .

ham,"Subject: enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business
opportunity ."

subject : bcp seat assignments
importance : high
all :
attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for business continuity planning ( bcp ) . these seats are located on the 30 th and 31 st floors of enron center north ( ecn ) . as previously communicated , you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ecs .
the exception to this is as follows :
if your seat assignment is located on the 31 st floor , you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ecs . this will hold true until the monday after thanksgiving , as we will have the 31 st floor seats set up at that time .
testing :
once you have moved to ecs , if you would like to test your bcp location , you will be able to test your seat for functionality every thursday from 3 - 6 pm . testing is not required , but is highly recommended .
if anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures , please feel free to contact me at any time .

i decided that i needed that same edge the younger guys were getting .
25 mg is best for me and i have found that vlagrra makes
me a super stud and the girl rides me and always has an orgasm or two . it
has made me much better in bed and i give her some very long and extended
foreplay now .
it has really helped my confidence knowing that if needed
i can give it to her any time she wants it .

technische universit?t m?nchen , germany : http : / / www . mpeg - 68 . de / location . php
the open workshop of musicnetwork is at its third edition . the modeling ofmusic
notation / representation is a complex problem . music representation can be used
for several different purposes : entertainment , music education , infotainment ,
music archiving and retrieval , music querying , music production , music profiling ,
etc . in the current internet and multimedia age many other applications are
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more diffuse
of the present applications in short time . end users have discovered the multimedia
experience , and thus , the traditional music models are going to be replaced by
their integration with multimedia , audio visual , cross media . at present , there is
a lack of music notation / representation standard integrated with multimedia . the
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music
notation / representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment ,
that presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of standard
formats for multimedia consumers .
the topics of the workshop are related mainly focused on :
- - music notation / representation requirements
- - music protection and distribution
- - music description and its usage on archive query
please contribute with your work on the above topics , for details see the www site
of the workshop .
the access is be free of charge , supported by the european commission .

here is to bring this to everyone attention and second to see if there is a
solution . i am taking a simplistic approach here in that since
intercompany sitara deals are the same that the nominations on both sides

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you

she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

ham,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

dear sir ,
i know this proposal will come to you as a surprise
expecially when you do not know the writer ,
condsidering , the huge sum of money involved which could make any
apprehensive .
let me start by introducing myself to you , i am mr . igho kadiri director credit control , union bank of nigeria plc . lagos . i saw your contact during my private search at the information centre here in nigeria chamber of commence and industry and i want to believe that you
will be very honest , committed and capable of assisting in this business venture .
firstly , let me explain the source of this funds and what you are expected to do . a forigner late engineer theophilus baker , an oil merchant / contractor with the government of nigeria , until his death , over a year ago , was a victim ofa kenya airways : bus ( a 310 - 300 ) flight
kq 430 plane crash . the deceased , engnieer theopilius baker , banked with us and has a closing balance as a july 2000 worth $ 4 . 5 m ( four million five hundred thosand usd ) . which my bank , now expectes a next - of - kin
to claim as the beneficiary of the funds , efforts has been made by union bank of nigeria to get in touch with the baker ' s family or relative but to no success .
based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate engnieer theopilus ' s next - of - kin , the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown
account .
it is based on this that we have contacted you to stand as the next - of - kin of late engr . theopilus baker so that the funds , will be released and paid into your account
as the beneficiary and the next - of - kin to the deceased . all documents , and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as we have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account . it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 20 % of the remitted funds , while we keep 75 % and 5 % will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes .
if this proposal satisfies you , please reach us only by mail , for more information .

ham,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with
hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,
can hpl sever the point some other way ?
someone let me hear what you think .

2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts

gary ,
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month . since spinnaker was paid gas
daily pricing for the month , there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we
are going to owe spinnaker an additional
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .
one issue that needs to be addressed is this : should the additional money go
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration ?
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :
thank you all ! !

sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

subject : special prayer request
hi ,
i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some good
friends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year old
baby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark was
diagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . he
also has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .
if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live to
july . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at the
anderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows of
a
strong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( when
possible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if a
donor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .
it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers and
i
know if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .
if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every little
prayer they get will be appreciated .
thank you !

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena

ham,"Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans ."

2 ) tetco meter 6892 - question of who has custody transfer at the meter .
ena is using tetco ' s volume and hplc is using the hpl measurement volume ,
causing a desk to desk variance .

3 ) transco bammel meter 74 - transco and hpl ' s nominations are out of
balance at meter 74 . charlotte needs to work with transco to resolve .
4 ) dow meter 4486 - the sale to entex needs to be taken off of hplc meter
4486 and the sale needs to be at dow meter 4486 .
a desk to desk between ena ( buyer )
and hplc ( seller ) needs to be set up on dow meter 4486 .
ami needs to set up the deals and
thu needs to coordinate the months involved .
once this is done and thu
reallocates to dow pipeline , jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and
make the meter non allocatable in pops .
clem verified with steve schneider
that this meter is not on hpl ' s system .
5 ) east texas gas / devon - devon invoicing ena entire flow at carthage .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

ham,"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state ."

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a | ong - term bull market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oil and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil belt
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
watch this stock friday morning

breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas providing opportunity
for 22 - we | | re - entry in field with strong producing history and large
recoverable reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and drilled by major
oi | companies
in the 1970 s . the fieid is estabiished with substantial recoverable reserves ,
estimated at over
3 . 9 miliion barrels of oil and about 2 bi | | ion cubic ft . of gas in the two pay
zones .
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bu | |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - millions , eogi is selling for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particulariy close attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably smal | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oi |
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daiiy jump in energy prices .
but all that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equally expiosive
effect on the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline
slightly , you wiil stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wi | | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oi | and
gas reserves are we | | established and are going into massive production .
early investors will secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in this

biel first fda cleared product , actipatch ( tm ) therapy is a dermal
patch with an embedded microchip that delivers weeks of continuous pulsed
electromagnetic energy . actipatch therapy is the miniaturized
equivalent of the large pulsed electromagnetic energy machines prescribed by
physicians for decades to reduce swelling , relieve pain and enhance the
healing of surgical incisions , accidental wounds , sprains , strains and
chronic wounds ( bedsores ) . actipatch ' s size , portability , ease of use
and relatively low price overcomes the obstacles to use associated with the
large , expensive , stationary machines . the introduction of actipatch
provides an immediate therapeutic alternative for the 200 million surgical
and non - surgical soft tissue injuries across the u . s . annually .
bioelectronics has launched it ' s actipatch product line in cooperative
distribution relationships with several well - established medical device
companies in various medical market segments .

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

ham,"Subject: neon retreat
ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .

and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for netco contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date . i suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out . again , the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time . take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes . we can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface .

hi all -
attached above is the master list of contracts we ' ll need for day 1 of newco . as the footnotes indicate , we ' ll also need new business party id ' s / passwords , an ebb agreement for all pipes and a tpa for each edi pipe ( tammy & i will be working on tpa ' s and ebb ' s ) . the timing indicated assumes that we have a clear newco structure , that the newco credit status has been identified , and that a duns number has been established . the two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines ' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through legal on each end , so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3 - 5 days even for pooling agreements . for the ldc ' s and intrastates , we ' ll need to specifically identify what each requires .
as we discussed , we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information :
pipeline contact name and number ( i know some of you sent me this b / f - - but pls make sure that it ' s the legal / regulatory contact , not your business counterpart )
credit requirements for a new entity with an "" a "" credit rating ( they may just refer you to the tariff , if so , pls . ask them for a specific site so we can do the research )
get a sense of the reaction of the pipe / ldc regarding credit for the new entity - - we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting .
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old enron bills , just reiterate that we ' re setting up a completely new entity and give them bob ' s , mine , or jeff hodge ' s name to discuss the estate issues .
if there are different requirements for different service levels ( ie , pooling vs . it vs . ft ) , pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe .
we need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level - - pls . ask the pipe / ldc to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it . once we have those together , i ' ll run the traps with legal .
it would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier , then work on the second .
i will be out of the office thursday & friday , but please call me on my cell phone at 713 - 516 - 2574 with any questions .
thanks ,

to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas
nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations .
the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company .
under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets .
among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , "" absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . "" kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money .
however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . "" dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , "" he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january .
still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice .
"" the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , "" a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others "" several weeks "" to respond ."

international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients .
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area .
as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) .
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to "" ride out the storm . ""
by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .
as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .
since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .
in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .
the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :
1 ) building very little "" owned "" infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .
2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .
3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .
the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .
the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .
the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .

ham,"Subject: new tax law update
whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes .
many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years .
but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start
planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include :
lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 .
and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the
next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals .
education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as :
? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to
$ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses .
? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 ,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits .
? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses .
? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses ,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college .
previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600
in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and
thereafter .
higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include :
? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these
types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 .
after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments .
? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t
include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older .
and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them .
as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes .
such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m
backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate
and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your
finances .
let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you .

attn : dear president / md .
with due respect , trust and humility , i use this
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do not know me , but please do consider this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance .
let me formally introduce myself . i am duve khumalo , the son of late . dr . robinson khumalo , the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer .
i got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual / company who can assist me in this business .
during the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group , because he did not support their ideas and policies .
in the course of the revolution in the country , the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father ' s farms burning , destroying and eventually killing him . after my father ' s death last year , i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother , because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us .
we escaped safely into south africa with my father ' s lifetime fortune of us $ 25 ( twenty five million
us dollars ) cash , bonds , important documents of property title and other valuables , which he instructed i his son on before his death . the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes , and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means .
the boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands .
presently , i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum .
at the moment , i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments . moreover , due to netherlands government ' s stringent monetary policies / regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region , it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances .
in recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country , i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments .
my mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money .
we have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund .
i have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us .
please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address ( khumaduvel 01 @ netscape . net ) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly , send your phone and fax number for easier communication .
if you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that i can look for a suitable alternative .
please accept my warm compliments , as i earnestly wait for your urgent response .
best regard ,
duve khumalo

subject : re : rate for tenaska deal
sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?
thanks ,

attached please find the hours survey and instructions for the month of may ,
2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the "" bar is being raised "" by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .
please note the following changes :
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not
necessarily take more time
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .

ham,"Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 17 , 2001
ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
"" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . ""
given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted ."

ham,"Subject: new version of stack manager
introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager ."

wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might
involve your desks via eol in the near future . we already have one in the
east . i stressed to the sitara / eol folks the importance of adding comments
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is
happening . one side of these buy / sell or exchange deals will be ratable and
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the
counterparty desires .
i hope this helps . . . thanks !

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
the one communicating with the counterparty ) . we probably need eol to
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .
linda / karen - what are your thoughts on how separate gtc would work on this .
if we could all do a little homework . i will get something scheduled for
next week to discuss further .

subject : flexible physical us nat gas products on enrononline
we are positioning ourselves to release a new product type that we will refer
to as a flexible physical gas product . legal is in the process of drafting a
gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
party a buys 10 , 000 mmbtu per day ( or 300 , 000 total mmbtu ) at tco pool index
party b has the right to notify party a of when party b wants to take
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . ; if
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of
sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .
bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then
my turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
please feel free to call if you have any questions .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

been split between el sordo and torch rally . i think all of the volume
should be under torch rally . please let me know if you find something

ham,"Subject: may activity survey
attached please find the activity survey for the month of may , 2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the "" bar is being raised "" by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
the attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial
teams . please select your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the
requested driver for the month of may . please fill out the attached activity
driver survey with may numbers for your rc and return to shari mao by end of
day friday , june 2 .
please note the following updates :
for nat gas , sally beck is interested in physical ( as denoted as ph in the
survey ) vs . financial ( as denoted as fi in the survey ) numbers , please
provide statistics accordingly
if a driver has not been updated per your request , please call or email
jennifer reside
if you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction ,
please call or email jennifer reside
if your group currently generates a standard report that captures the
surveyed data , please send the report to jennifer reside . this will
eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month . if you would like
us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next
month , please let jennifer know .
please contact jennifer reside x 3 - 5971 with questions ( shari is on vacation
this week ) , or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted

pat ,
i have been working with volume management , settlements , vance , and bob to
clean up some prior period and prior - to - current month issues . this process
should result in a correction to booked profit / loss for vance and the desk .
this has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties
manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered . i would propose
that logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually
cut . it would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by
counterparty , meter , and / or deal ticket id or price . i feel that this will
allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively .
please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter .
thank you for your time ,

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

ham,"Subject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations
per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the
disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this
time , the general land office is transporting their share of production
( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % .
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september
1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl
purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had
both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a
callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management .
for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter
to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their
percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement .
anita : for september , i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket
379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport
and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology .
i apologize for the length of this email , i want to make sure that we are all
on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal
getting too far down the road . please do not hesitate to call me if you have
any questions , comments , concerns , etc . i am at extension 35251 .

thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given
in kansas at the opening session of their senate . it
seems prayer still upsets some people .
when minister joe wright was asked to open the new
session of the kansas senate , everyone was expecting
the usual generalities , but this is what they heard :
"" heavenly father , we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance .
we know your word says , "" woe to those who call evil
good "" , but that is exactly what we have done .
we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values . we confess that .
we have ridiculed the absolute truth of your word and
called it pluralism .
we have exploited the poor and called it the lottery ,
we have rewarded laziness and called it welfare ,
we have killed our unborn and called it choice ,
we have shot abortionists and called it justifiable ,
we have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self - esteem ,
we have abused power and called it politics ,
we have coveted our neighbor ' s possessions and called
it ambition ,
we have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement ,
we have ridiculed the time - honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment .
search us , oh , god , and know our hearts today ; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free . guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of your son , the living savior , jesus
christ . "" amen . ! ! ""
the response was immediate . a number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest . in 6 short
weeks , central christian church , where rev . wright is
pastor , logged more than 5 , 000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively . the church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from india , africa , and korea .
commentator paul harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program , "" the rest of the story "" , and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired . with the lord ' s help , may this prayer
sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our
desire so that we again can be called , "" one nation
under god . "" if possible , please pass this prayer on
to your friends . think about this : if you forward
this prayer to everyone on your email list in less
than 30 days it would be heard by the world .

ham,"Subject: re : big cowboy for august
mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .

subject : big cowboy for august
daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .
thank you ,

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play "" capture the flag "" . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours .

the database for may is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this is
the shortcut on your desktop called "" statistical database "" .
as there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations , investor
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for may 2000 and provide explanations
for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year , quarter / quarter , and

essential that the volumes be verified by commercial personnel .

i ' m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me . if you
are not , could you please let me know who i need to speak to .
for meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3 / 00 production forward , this deal is set
up under the wrong sitara # , therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara .

was only for 1 / 00 production . the new sitara number that we should be using
is
sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032

tradestar
corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing
on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have
followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have
profited nicely . the company tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior
oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset
drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have "" the largest untapped
potential for natural gas in north america . "" new prices and technologies have
exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over
90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil
and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south
of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in
economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease
values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from
several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total
output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset
wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas
@ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6
months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again !
using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to
tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most
prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! !
withabalanced portfolioofoilgas
properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign ,
experienced management team , and application of cutting edge
ep technologies , we believe that
tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment
portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a
company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy
prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to
bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk
to the company ! ! ! !

ham,"Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting
hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !
mike

today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $ 666 trillion .
in the deal , enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades '
facilities throughout and under north america . john d . rockefeller , former
ceo of energy monopolist standard oil , is now head of hades ' energy
management division . said rockefeller , "" obviously hell has significant
heating demands . while eternal flames are a great idea in concept , they
require vast and reliable fuel resources . enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss , and , as a former monopolist , i just
like the way they do business . ""
a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations . according to the company , "" the deal fits both
companies exceptionally well . with hades ' ability to attract and retain new
customers , we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come . "" according to several energy industry insiders , hades ' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition .
hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers . the entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years .
enron is one of the world ' s leading energy and communications companies .
the company owns approximately $ 37 billion in energy and communications
assets . enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune ' s "" best 100 companies to
work for if you can keep a job there and don ' t mind working 80 hours a
week , "" and is among the most respected corporations in america , as ranked by
customers with respect - us - or - get - curtailed clauses in their energy supply

meter 098 - 4179 , goliad co . , tx
in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

ham,"Subject: organization announcement
enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,
with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in
internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically
sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are
significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial
potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business
e - commerce venture .
effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing
unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic
sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset
operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus
on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand
for products and services with the objective of creating a future
business - to - business e - commerce venture .
it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director ,
will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike
mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology .
george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior
executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron
south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief
executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief
executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( "" tgs "" ) from june
1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial
positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron
international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline
company .
please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating
george in his new role with the company ."

dear sir ,
i know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the
only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business .
it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and
assistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am
dr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former
military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )
who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as
i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,
hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country .
having noted the confidence reposed on your person ,
i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving
the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general
( my husband ) .
this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have
all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for
safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .
it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my
organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this
organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .
on your acceptance to render this assistance to me
to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for
non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian
administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the
federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family
because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late
husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have
resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including
properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the
various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,
the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of
seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our
family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .
in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our
family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the
demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very
soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas
amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come
to my full assistance and unlimited
co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole
family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the
sins
of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy
and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my
children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of
the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .
in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your
discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in
your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur
( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by
you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my
children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with
the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe
operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance
company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide
owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through
dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and
phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .
i look forward to your quick response while thanking
you for your co - operation . in view of all above
details , i request you to keep this letter and
co - operation highly confidential .
best wishes ,
mrs . mariam abacha .

gary , mainline valves to be closed on the 18 "" 3026 line are as follows :
u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back
in service on 4 / 16 / 00 .

which mainline valves will be closed during the work and can you send me a
list of the meters in the affected section ? i need to get with the texas
desk prior to their pre - bid meeting which is this friday , march 24 .
based on the changes , it still appears to me the work is planned for the last
week in april . as a date becomes firm please let me know .

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

darren :
here is my problem . as you know , hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude . the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude . bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc , ena and egm that would book the deal correctly . julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february , except for one small part , but march forward was never completed . the attached word document explains the procedure . basically , we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price . this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo . then , we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only ( no volume ) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude ( no volume ) . for these deals , we would use demand fees . egm will pay ena for the crude dollars .
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move . you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo . julie zeroed this out , but o ' neal put it back . i ' ve left him a message to find out why .
1 . sale from hplc - im wellhead to tglo 547201
2 . sale from hplc - im hplc to hplc - im wellhead 547205
3 . sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - im wellhead texas 679847
4 . sale from ena - im wellhead texas to egm 679859
here is a preliminary list of what needs to be done to finish out the transactions for march , april and may . the previous email went to kam keiser , john grass , linda roberts and dayem khandker . they may be able to help us work through this . let me know if you have any questions .

2 . enter a ticket for the hpl - wellhead sale to ena - wellhead for march , april and may 2001 ( the feb deal number is 679848 ) for the value of the gas below . this should be entered as a demand fee only , no volume .

enron capital meter no . : 6884
julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?
thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
information .

let me know if something i stated is incorrect or if anyone has any
additional information ."

this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended

ham,"Subject: re : tenaska iv march 2001
yes , the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from williams . i will take the credit with our payment to williams on the 25 th . tenaska will send us their wire to us on the 24 th . i will make sure we receive the wire from tenaska before i send the wire to williams . i will also let james know about the volume for the agency fee . i thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume , not the nominated volume .

i have changed the demand fee . but , is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams ? i don ' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams . additionally , i believe that we need to keep the volume at 45 , 000 for the admin fee , since we originally nominated 45 , 000 / day .

welcome to the expatriate zone
welcome to the "" first "" issue of "" the expatriate zone , "" the official
newsletter of the new "" expatriate zone "" web site . after publishing "" the
temperate zone "" for the past two years , i ' m taking the opportunity to join
forces with bob segel who has been publishing "" the coconut modem "" with karen
coyne since april of 1994 .
last year , after operating in aol exclusively , bob created "" parrotkey . com ""
out on the "" internet "" where it would join it ' s sister site on aol and be
accessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded "" pk , "" we had been
working on my little area of "" club st . somewhere , "" and the new
"" parrotkey . com "" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .
while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see "" club st .
somewhere "" and "" parrot key "" go , we could see that this was the perfect chance
to , as emeril says , "" kick it up a notch . ""
jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the
"" expatriate lifestyle "" he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical
travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and
lyrics of mr . james w . buffett .
so it is , that we created our new web site , "" the expatriate zone ""
, along with this newsletter of that same
name . in december , "" the expatriate zone "" opened its doors with its "" island
trading post "" with its holiday shopping service at the "" island trading post . ""
over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks . the "" island trading post "" will open again
soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the
"" t - shirt of the month . ""
we want "" the expatriate zone "" to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday "" corporate gig , "" but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into "" the
expatriate zone . ""
we hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit "" parrot key ""
and "" club st . somewhere . "" both of which will be closely associated with "" the
expatriate zone "" and "" parrotkey . com . ""

"" expatriate of the month ""
james "" sunny jim "" white
when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named "" sunny
jim "" who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance
to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to
happen , it usually does .
on the first leg of my "" road dawg "" tour
( click on "" road dawg "" ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and
their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex
and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was
"" sunny jim . "" i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it
immediately . the cd was his second , called "" life in the laid back lane . ""
little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady "" shady floyd ""
several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real
tour of the us since he moved "" down island "" almost twelve years ago . we got
several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article
about this "" expatriate "" soon on "" the expatriate zone "" web site . be sure to
watch for it .
in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great
musician . when i asked him about his "" expatriate "" status , his reply was ,
"" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,
for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they
want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms . ""
even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? "" maybe
somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another , "" was the advice he gave .
until we can learn more of "" sunny jim ' s "" world , stop by his web site at
and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his
latest release "" sandbar serenade , "" for goodness sake , pick one up . you can
also read a great interview alex conducted with james at

"" some are running from the irs ""
we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,
cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if
we feel the need . but get real and throw that "" pager "" away as soon as you can .
we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in "" the zone , "" helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that
are preparing to "" disappear "" to places like costa rica , where the "" the

how would you like to check out a place to "" disappear "" to and write it off
your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into "" the zone "" to places like
the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic
or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a
coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?
well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .
depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up

"" jimmydotcom ""
after many delays , "" jimmydotcom "" has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of april . i hit some "" bumps in the road "" on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was
all worth it .
this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on
parrot heads . for more information , visit . we
have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and
samples of the pages on the site .
financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at
the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the "" reservation list . "" you will be
under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial
partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do
it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a
copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .
let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big
success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .
maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "" that
just don ' t get it . ""
here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &
president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with
this club on the "" road dawg "" tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :
"" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .
we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs
from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is
your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! ""

club trini update
speaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of "" the
zone ? "" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this
april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert
pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third
in the "" margaritaville cafe - late nite "" series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as
my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was
recorded .
you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s
revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve
become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t
heard ct ' s version of "" african friend "" you ' re in for a real treat . along with
that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer , "" cario "" and bob marley ' s "" no woman , no cry . ""
at the new web site , fans can "" now "" order their favorite club trini cds using
their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available .
i think a true "" expatriate musical library "" is incomplete without club trini .
this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer ,
came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the "" ice cream
vendor "" shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,
pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves
somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a
t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .

millennium change bubba style
i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this "" new millennium "" thing , one
bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve
show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at
the last minute , i had a change of heart .
and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new
margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded
together for me , making the millennium change over very special .

flash ! ! ! "" expatriated phans "" spotted south of the border
after making both of "" tropo travel ' s "" previous trips down to cobo san lucas ,
mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the "" beach house
on the moon "" tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing .
as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from "" the expatriated phan club ""
showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that
said , "" too much tequila . . . or not quite enough "" on the back . who are those
people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars
covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
"" down to the banana republics - 2000 "" visit mike
mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out .
speaking of "" tropo travel , "" if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine
shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m
joining some of my parrot head friends at the "" key largo , "" though i ' m kind of
afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit
phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i
hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing
all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer
ends up playing there again this year .
and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at
the "" island store . "" they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year ' s trip , except they have "" tropo travel ' s "" seaplane on the back and the
"" no bad days "" logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cabie companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
internationa | inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dia | - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 200 , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 4 o , 0 oo , 00 o ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potentia | for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptabie product .
about nomad international inc .

company deveioping cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technoiogies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line ca | | ed nomad systems that has dia | - up , broadband , dsl ,

ham,"Subject: big thicket allocation
anita ,
after speaking with gary lamphier , big thicket ' s allocation for
pecos ' / roberson ' s portion will be done differently . historically , their
portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage . effective with october
00 ' s allocation , shrink will no longer be deducted . the full amount of
pecos / roberson ' s gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714
( vastar ) will be kept whole . i spoke with your contact harold mcgee at big
thicket and he spoke with pecos / roberson regarding this and everyone is
agreement . your allocation process will be done the same , however the
pecos / roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have
shrinkage deducted . i have gone over the numbers for october with harold and
he has stated the 23 , 174 is the amount that will be allocated to
pecos / roberson , 946 will go to jay , and 9114 will be for enron ( this portion
has always been kept whole ) . can you please make sure that this is done . if
there are any questions , please let me know . thanks ."

spam,"Subject: from mrs . juliana
dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

ham,"Subject: jill ,
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .
call with any questions

work 713 - 345 - 7754

ps - just a reminder , we are getting the volumes quoted at our preferred liquid point and it will be eex ' s responsibility / burden to get the gas to that point ."

subject : netco items
wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

please respond to hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let him call to tell me about it . i hope he gets his teary eye "" fixed "" .
lacy ' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes . he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week . we ' ll talk later about when we are coming to your house . i ' m going to longview to a singles retreat sat . in case you call & i ' m not there . will be home sat . night . love ya , maw"

ham,"Subject: brandywine meter # : 981225 ; march , 2000 activity
there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

market watch news flash
explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many
significant news releases indicate strong contractual
revenues with major telecom firms .
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands
for their innovative patented products and expansion into
international telecom markets .
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior
patented outside plant electrical surge protection
equipment for the telecommunications industry .
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate
the industry .
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest
quality protection element for complex digital switches .
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .
major telecoms require this protection throughout their
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive
system failures .

how many times have you seen issues explode but you
couldn ' t get your hands on them or didn ' t have the right
information in time ? we are alerting you now to a special
company with a unique technology that is on the forefront
of a breakout ! we are excited about srge ' s technology
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases
in revenue for 2004 and 2005 . srge has made phenomenal
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued ,
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative .

ham,"Subject: re : path manager rewrite / optimization project
since lisa used fuchsia , i ' ll use lavender . .
on # 1 i would eliminate that processing . in addition , can we delete / hide / not access old paths that haven ' t been used in gas production in lets say a year or so . would this help performance ? this would also force the schedulers to path / think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate ! ! we ' ve seen old bad , zero paths be re - used accidentally .
on # 2 , the scheduling position window is the weakest link . . . . . goodbye !
on # 3 , contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list . nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments . do we need it in the inventory list ? probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it ' s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts .
on # 4 , we use this functionality alot on cgas , tenn , trco and sab . . . when we path one to many or many to one in "" chunks , "" it does seem to go faster than one path at a time .
on # 5 , brokered paths could really just be slammed in there . no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard ."

hey guys ,
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !
