ham,"Subject: yesterday ' s off - site
just want to pat each of you on the back , and express my appreciation to each
of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday . the results
of our time exceeded my expectations in that i feel we had quality discussion
and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly . each
of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and
positive manner . i also realize we have some follow - up to do , and would
like for us to schedule our next time to meet . i don ' t want to establish
these discussions as "" quarterly "" or "" monthly "" meetings at this point - i ' m
not sure what frequency would be appropriate . we can discuss it further as a
team . however , i know we at least one more session and i don ' t want much
time to elapse before we reconvene .
yvette : would look at a time when everyone would be availble in march ,
preferably the week of 3 / 6 , 3 / 13 or 3 / 20 . this may be difficult to schedule
as daren will be working around a new baby , and others are working around
vacation time . i anticipate a similar structure to yesterday ' s , but am very
open to other ' s ideas . please let yvette know if you some other idea .
i also want to express my appreciation to yvette for organizing the
afternoon . she did a great job ! ! !
thanks to each of you ! !"

ham,"Subject: memo from office of the chair
the mid - year performance management cycle will begin on may 15 with the
opening of the pep system ( the online "" performance evaluation process ""
feedback system ) . you will be receiving your password for this system in a
note to go out later from pep . in preparation for the cycle , four training
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who have
not previously attended training . enrollment for these classes will be
offered through the development center "" ernie "" system . for employees who are
outside the houston area , please contact your hr representative for more
information .
these sessions will be held on :
wednesday , may 10 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . , and three sessions to be held on
thursday , may 11 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . ; 1 : 30 - 2 : 30 p . m . ; and 3 : 00 - 4 : 00 p . m .
all sessions will be held at the doubletree hotel .
to register , click on this link to go directly to the development center
for those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar
with the past performance management process , there have been some
modifications :
1 . the performance management process is now enron wide . all enron feedback
forms have been reduced to three ( vice president ( vp ) / managing director
( md ) ; management / professional ; and administration / support ) , which all use
the following criteria :
? innovation / entrepreneurship
? communication / setting direction
? teamwork / interpersonal
? leadership / vision / values
? business instinct
? analytical / technical
2 . the following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the
final feedback forms across enron :
superior
excellent
strong
satisfactory
needs improvement
issues
3 . there will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purposes
of the prc ( formerly the business review meetings ) meeting .
? commercial
? commercial support
? technical
? specialized technical
4 . the performance review process will continue to be used to facilitate :
? promotions - up to director level only . there will be no officer promotions
to vp / md at mid - year
? feedback to employee
? compensation decisions
? sharing of performance rating at manager  , s discretion
5 . prc meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships .
functional prc meetings will take place first , followed by the final business
unit meetings . difference in views on an individual employee  , s rating should
be discussed and consensus should be reached . the functional area meetings
are :
- accounting
- human resources
- government affairs
- rac
- global finance
6 . the pep system is now available via the intranet to allow greater access
from global locations and remotely . the functionality is essentially the
same . if you would like further information on how to use this system you may
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking on the attached
weblinkhttp : / / home . enron . com / announce / . pdf . if the
quick reference does not display correctly on your pc , call your help desk
for assistance , or irma alvarez at 713 - 853 - 1543 to get a hard copy .
7 . the general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall
process :
employee / reviewer responsibilities :
select 5 - 7 reviewers
complete self - assessment
complete requested feedback forms
reviewers who cannot provide feedback use the decline request feature
supervisor responsibilities :
approve reviewers ( at least 3 of the employee ' s choices )
communicate modifications to employee
participate in prc meetings as required
summarize feedback and complete appropriate feedback form
communicate feedback to the employee
schedule for mid - year performance review
may 15 pep system opens for feedback
june 9 pep system closes for feedback
june 12 functional / business unit prc meetings begin
july 20 prc meetings should finish
july 31 / august 1 vp & md prc meeting
as always , if you have further questions on the performance management
process , you may contact your hr representative ."

ham,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

sorry for the delay . . . ami
1 . tom asked for a historical number for entex the 2 nd week on the job in the
morning meeting . he wasn  , t expecting me to bring forth anything because i had
just started . no one provided any information after the first day , so i
decided to look it up and do it myself . tom was very pleased .
2 . tom gave that info to ed , and he asked for further data :
a . about cinco ranch , greatwood , and spring interconnects
i coordinated with brad blevins and applied it to the fact that origination
was booked for nov , but the points had yet to be operational . brad and i
remain in close contact to share any entex interconnect info .
b . research transport info
documented why entex transport volumes decreased by 6000 , and used info
towards the audit
c . check weather forecast for nov
i got weather info from mike roberts and developed some volumes that
corresponded with historical data related to the average of the forecast . tom  ,
s response was , "" this is great . why hasn  , t anyone been able to do this
before . ""
3 . prepare and present entex info in morning meetings and prebid meetings .
4 . work with weather research group to get better understanding of entex
trends .
5 . prepare information gathering entex data including :
midcon vols
price behavior
temperature and weather conditions
hpl vols
6 . thoroughly understand and apply entex contracts :
- realize need for daily vols and mentor summer intern to put together data
base of historical information ( winter cap )
- recognized accounting discrepancy that saved us $ 11 , 000
- reorganized entex tracking spreadsheets to incorporate a variety of info ,
including booked volumes , weather , and contract terms
- part of the audit team
7 . managed weather hedge ( swap and put )
after doing some background work , i found out that the weather research group
was incorrect , and their files were feeding incorrect data ( iah temps instead
of hou temps ) . this find resulted in a gain on of $ 3 , 376 , 780 .
8 . handle ces deals on the texas desk
- organized and facilitated a meeting with back office to review all ces deals
- incorporated all ces info with enron systems
- fully gather all data
- liaison between devon and enron ( whole trade floor )
- ensure all information was correct
- praised by :
joan quick - "" you went above and beyond the call of duty ""
howard camp - "" when i met with the other regions , texas was the only one that
had its the info in line and organized ""
9 . develop good relationship with entex
10 . facilitate monthly meeting with cross - functional entex team to resolve

with sap now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all
have to make immediately .
first :
everyone will have to make internet explorer their default browser . if
you ' re not sure how to do this give me a call and i will help . the reason
for this is that our new timesheet program will only run through internet
explorer .
second :
sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where i will walk you
through entering your time in this new system . it ' s not time consuming just
different .
third :
next thursday you will be e - mailed an sap log - on id and password . please
don ' t delete or disregard the importance of this e - mail . you will need it to
key your time .
fourth :
all company and rc # ' s are changing . the company part is easy . it will be 4
digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if
it is 012 it will now be 0012 . easy . rc # ' s are now called cost centers and
they are changing completely . please write these down somewhere you will
need them just like you need to know your rc .
rc 1497 = cc 105633
rc 1638 = cc 105634
rc 2664 = cc 105630
rc 2933 = cc 106292
rc 0688 = cc 105631
rc 1160 = cc 105632
rc 2675 = cc 105638
rc 2939 = cc 106269
rc 2940 = cc 106290
rc 2663 = cc 105629
the transition shouldn ' t be too painful for you but it promises to be a
little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate .
thank you !

26 , 000 . 000 . 00 usd ) twenty six million united states dollars and no other person knows about this account . i am contacting you for me to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary , i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here , without valid international foreign passport , but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a / c because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a / c mr . ravindra f . shah is a foreigner too , and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a / c .

instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business .
at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 40 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me . i look forward to your earliest reply through
my email or you call me on phone .

nomad international inc . ( ndin )
a multi - national internet communications company developing cost
effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip )
technologies .
shares outstanding : 34 , 0 oo , 000
float : 4 , 000 , 0 oo
current price : o . 09
wiil it continue higher ? watch this one friday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - teievision and teiecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would reguiate voice over internet protoco |
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainable competition in | ocal teiephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wiil not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifie competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cabie companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
internationa | inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dia | - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 200 , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 4 o , 0 oo , 00 o ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potentia | for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptabie product .

darren ,
i joined brian redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to sid richardson . during that visit sr indicated that they have firm lone star transport that they want to sell ( only details i know at this time is that it is 45 mm / d point to point on a true firm basis ) . i believe we could use this transport to back stop the falcon transaction ( parking gas in their facility oct / nov 01 - jan 04 ) . i spoke with the folks at sr today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally . they gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details . i understand you would be the right person to a ) . bounce this idea off of and b ) . if there is an interest on this transport i presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from sr .
the name of the person to talk to at sr is scott walker ( 817 . 810 . 9385 ) .

ham,"Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 17 , 2001
ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
"" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . ""
given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted ."

i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?
duke energy 206 is still a problem .
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large
number to me , can we net some of them ?
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed ?
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,
how old is this imbalnce ?
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can
we resolve this ?
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions .
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach ."

robert ,
i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation
exception screen ) . i ' m going to place 98 - 9676 on strangers gas until you
hear back from daren or julie .
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back
w / anita luong and provide her with the k # given to you ( by daren or julie )
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my
allocation exception screen ) so that she can provide you with an accounting
arrangement to place february ' s volumes on @ this meter .
it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter .

now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bull market ,

4 . montana oil and gas speciaiizes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the

one of the most effective ways to acquire financia | partners for drilling programs invoives existing production of oil and or gas in these programs . this wiil significantiy lessens the risk for the investment group , hence encouraging financial participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment group .
the sylvan lake project will begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a driiling rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted . the rig is currentiy sitting in red deer aiberta a mere 30 miles from syivan lake . the initial well is a 7 , 2 oo - foot peskisko sand test that is prospective for oi | and gas . it is expected to take approximateiy 10 to 12 days to dril | and test the initia | wel | . each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 15 o barreis of oil per day and 75 o miilion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 biilion cubic feet gas and 3 oo , 0 oo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average wel | in the syivan lake fieid has produced 50 o barrels of oi | per day with over one mi | | ion cubic feet of gas per day . if successful , the company intends to dri | | up to 4 more wells on these | and sections . for more detaiied information on this project please see news reiease dated feb . 7 th , 2 oo 5 . an announcement wiil be made immediateiy upon the commencement of driiling .
the company is aiso pieased to report that the tie in of its west lock project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this will be complete some time in the next couple of days . peter sanders notes  the compietion and tie in of the west lock project has ran into numerous delays , however , this wel | wil | be tied in and the company wil | be se | | ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company  the company wi | | update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion .

please respond to hi , just wanted to let you know that lacy ' s sugar levels are staying up pretty well . she was down to 51 this morning , but she took a shot last night & i guess she didn ' t eat enough ice cream . she was mad at me cause i didn ' t give her more than i did . but it ' s so hard to know exactly how to handle it ' cause she ' s been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high . but anyway , she ' s doing better & i guess she ' ll always be mad & think i ' m mistreating her . i stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low after i left & passed out & no one would know it . i ' m going to try to get a cell phone & have her call me when she gets there - - i think - - i don ' t know - - she ' ll be mad about that too . but the other night , she didn ' t eat right after she took her shot , then didn ' t eat anything fast acting & got in the truck to go over to phillip ' s to get research info from his computer , got low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs . so that ' s what scares me . she knew to eat righ !
t after she took that shot & didn ' t . but she was high before she took it & i guess she didn ' t think about it getting low . i don ' t know what will happen to her when she leaves home .
but anyway , i wanted to let you know that we ' re going to dallas to look for the prom dress & shoes , don ' t know if we will stay all night or not . i haven ' t talked to shane & shelley . i wanted to stay & go to saturn rd . to church & go to the singles class . but i don ' t know what shane & shelley have planned . so we ' ll be back either sat . night or sun . lacy has to be back to work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once . so , wish us luck . any donations will be appreciated ! i hear they ' re more than i was expecting . but anyway , i don ' t intend to go overboard . maybe there will be some sales .
hope my grandsons are doing ok . i bet they were glad that their daddy got back home sunday . hug them for me & tell cole that mimi can ' t wait to see his bunkbeds . love ya ' ll"

darren , per our earlier conversation , here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the freeport area off of dow .
the potential customer ( don owen ) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years , buying supply from dow .
dow does not want to be a supplier in the future , but of course , will transport .
dow will quote only a 2 year transport ( $ 0 . 06 from katy to the plant ) , but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years .
other bids he is getting at index + . 03 / . 04 less whatever transport .
the swing load is approx . 1300 - 1350 mmbtu / d , but fairly steady he says .
let me know if you have any interest or if i should pass this along to someone else . thanks .
ps the customer will give more info if we are interested , but wanted to see if we have interest first ( and also if we had long term capacity on dow )"

breaking news : posted jan 9 , 2 : 28 pm
dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas
nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations .
the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company .
under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets .
among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , "" absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . "" kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money .
however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . "" dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , "" he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january .
still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice .
"" the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , "" a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others "" several weeks "" to respond ."

subject : filling vacancies and adding head count
after my recent budgeting experience , i think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count .
when filling vacancies , i would like to have each of you review the positions . i think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible . i would like to sign off on all replacements . i promise not to be difficult .
when adding personnel over your current budgeted number , besides having the commercial team sign - off on the addition , i am think
that it may have to be approved by the coo of americas ( louise ) . i am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes ( asset management deals or service arrangements )
let me know what you think .

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

in response to cheryl ' s note , in looking at a copy of a confirmation letter
confirming the proposed agreement reached on march 1 , 2000 to be effective
april 1 , 2000 through march 31 , 2001 , there is evergreen language .
a termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to exxon with an original
to follow for their records .
cheryl , this gtc is different from the ones we usually see in that hpl
required signatures from both parties executed by exxon on 3 / 30 / 00 and hpl on
8 / 21 / 00 .

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial

does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

it ' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations !
the database for august is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this
is the shortcut on your desktop called "" statistical database "" .
as there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations , investor
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for august 2000 and provide
explanations for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year ,
quarter / quarter , and month / month variances . the current objective of
investor relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential
investor or analyst questions , but it may be used for ad hoc requests and
presentations . it is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial
personnel .
please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10 : 00 am
friday , september 22 . please feel free to call with any questions .

daren and lauri :
we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an
"" incomplete "" from the parent meter it sends a - 0 - to pops . yes , this is a
big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from
mips and overrode the bav with a - 0 - from day 14 forward .
this was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated .

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions ."

ham,"Subject: monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

hello again ,
my monthly newsletter is attached . please read it and let me
know your comments .
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .

what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

does it make a difference if the information is communicated via a copy of

deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20 . the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround .
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown .
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer .

howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,
michael"

subject : possibly adding deal prices to path manager
donna ,
a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related "" baggage "" :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work "" tiered "" and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .
let me know what you hear . d . n ."

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

i also spoke to jim tobacco at epgt for at least an hour or so , going over every line item which was rejected , please get with me once you are back in the office
and i will go over the "" correct "" pathing procedures .
i met with richard and reviewed november transactions for epgt to determine if we could eliminate the external pools but unfortunately we cannot do this .
if we transport then we must use the external pool . however , you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently
using , therefore , i have terminated the internal pools .
please review the changes and let me know if this will work for you . .
i will be in touch with you after i meet with el paso ."

hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !

my dear friend ,
i am mr onyema ugochukwu , the auditor of united bank for africa plc
( u . b . a ) . i have a confidential business suggestion for you . one of our
clients / personalfriend , late mr . kim sean unfortunately lost his life
in the plane crash on january 31 st 2000 including his wife and his only
daughter .
late mr . kim sean is a foreigner and the manager of granite minning
nig , a chemical engineer by profession and he died since the year 2000 .
no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it .
after further investigation it was also discovered that mr . kim sean ' s next
of kin is his daughter who died with him , hence the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proves to me as well that his company does
not know anything about this account and the amount involved is us $ 65 million .
i am contacting you to stand and act as the next of kin to mr . kim
sean . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 40 % of the
total amount , while 60 % will be for me , and any expenses which you and
me may incur during the process of this transaction will also be reconciled
afterwards .
let me have your confidential telephone , fax and mobile numbers . my
private email is : ( mronyemaugochukwu 2 @ ureach . com )
yours truly ,

spam,"Subject: please read this
hi there
hope you don ' t mind me contacting you , but i thought you may be interested
in
this , as like me , you are obviously serious about making some money . . .
i have heard nothing but great things about this . so give it a shot .
 5 . . . that ' s all it takes . . .
i ' ll keep it short and sweet .
to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it
in an
e - mail to edit it .
once i got started the money started rolling in ! ! ! just like the plan below
said it would !
i am currently getting over  200 a day and just started
weekago ! ! ! ! !
believe it or not , this is my 2 nd time around . simply follow the
instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks , you will have at least  20 , 000 in
your
paypal account .
most people respond to this program because of the low investment (  5 ) and
high profit potential . the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 % . there is no
limit
to the income you can generate from this business ( you can do it over and
over ) . this program is the fastest , easiest program you will ever do .
the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place .
if
they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to , and
only
make a few pounds .
if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people ! honesty ,
faith and integrity make this system work .
team work makes the dream work ! lets get started !
i think everyone has heard of "" paypal "" ( if not you will ) . paypal ( owned by
ebay ) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online . anyone
with
an email address can join for free ! if you ' re not already a paypal user , the
first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free :
use the link above to sign up for a free account , then send a  5 . 00 donation
from
your paypal account ( you will earn back  5 . 00 from paypal , for signing up
anyway ! ) to only the first email address on the list along with a note
saying : "" please add me to your mailing list "" .
now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying "" thanks i ' ve joined "" .
then , remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom .
this
should move the second place into the first place and the third place into
second and fourth into the third .
don ' t try to place yourself in the first place .
it will only reach the people you send it to , and then your name will be
removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system
work .
if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time
your name gets to the top . remember to only send a  5 . 00 donation to the
first
e - mail address , and send "" thanks i ' ve joined "" to the fourth person . this
lets the
4 th person keep track of their progress .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1 . siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail . com
2 . jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail . com
3 . @ hotmail . com
4 . nic @ madstock . freeserve . co . uk
now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth
person a note , place your email address in the fourth place ( make sure its
the
same email address you used for your paypal account ) this is the way you
will
receive payment .
ok , the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more ( ! ) of
this
letter in a week or so . when your name reaches the top of the list it will
be
your turn to collect your money from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people just like
yourself
who are willing to spend  5 . 00 and half an hour of there time to receive
 20 , 000
in cash ! keep in mind . . . the most you ' ve spent is  5 .
testimonials : d . rayner london : i only have one thing to say to
you . . . . oh my god ! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on
holiday . when i got back my account had over  12 , 000 in it already ! i ' m
still
floating on air ( especially with my new car i bought ! ) !
thanks !
this programe works , it really does .
so good luck to the rest of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through

gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then

thoughts on texas a & m . . .
fox sports show host jim rome
1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and
red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite ut .
2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from
where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m
to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation . like danny devito in "" twins "" .
3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good .
all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they
won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how
they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is
the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in
everything a & m does .
4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at
a & m .
there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '
answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,
forget the fact that a however ,
nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act
like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect
these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians , move to israel .
5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national
television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be
against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked
down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have
moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s
thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .
some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique
counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give
them a veil .
6 ) "" t . u . "" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if
folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be
funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .
please learn .
7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of
sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall
down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit
whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing
how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for
governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form
asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 "" , weight
185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east
texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade
education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .
this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .
8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,
they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .
the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about
marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?
9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .
10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly .
11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that
it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that
should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any
better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
"" dukes of hazard "" episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to
austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open
minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool .
as my friend stephen johnson once said : "" if the world were ever to get an
enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . "" if you go to
school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie .
god bless the great state of texas .

est . shares outstanding 38 , 000 , 000
est . float 2 , 000 , 000
recent price $ 0 . 71
tirr is up over 70 % in the past two weeks ! ! !
tradestar corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have profited nicely .
the company
tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america . new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas @ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again ! using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! ! with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign , experienced management team , and application of cutting edge ep technologies , we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company ! ! ! !
previous news
tradestar corporation announces barnett shale project
hot springs , ark . , - - tradestar ( otc : tirr ) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture agreement with united production and exploration of houston , texas to reenter and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county , texas . in addition to the gas well reentry , the prospect , which covers 111 acres , has an additional location to drill a new well . the objective formation of the recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of approximately 4 , 830 ' to 5 , 030 ' with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone . estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750 , 000 mcf for each well .
why we love this stock
1 . continued rise in world oil gas prices !
2 . over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas
3 . strong industry investment banking relationships
4 . strong management - over 50 years of experience in the oil patch
5 . multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners
6 . tight float , low entry price strong upward potential !
7 . business model offers only real solution to u . s . dependency on foreign oil .
8 . the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est . reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas !
conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm . the company ' s resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more information on tirr , go to tradestar - corp . com for sec filings or press releases .
this is one of our top recommendations this year . we are giving tirr our seal of approval .

on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep

ham,"Subject: re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february
please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .
thank you for your time . please let me know if you have any questions , comments , suggestions .

the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products

effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp .

pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

ham,"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state ."

i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .

subject : re : meter 1428 oct 99 - beaumont methanol
lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,

this just in ags ! if you are going to the osu game on sept 22 , a red , white

game .
ags , what better statement can we aggies make , than to celebrate the love
and support for our country ' s freedom , and our patriotic nature , than this
way :
imagine . . . the fightin ' texas aggie band playing "" the star spangled banner , ""
playing military drills as they walk around the stadium , and we celebrate
our love for our country , and our support for all the heroes , alive and
deceased . color assignments are as follows :
3 rd deck : red
2 nd deck : white lst deck : blue
pass the word on . . . . we have 1 1 / 2 weeks ! !
the spirit of america , and the aggie spirit is still alive . god bless
america , the free nation .
pass it on ."

fred :
i have run this issue by clem cernosek for further research , and expect to
have his answer this afternoon . in the meantime , it is my understanding that
this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket
380710 , purchase from ccgm , l . p . on hplc / hplc . this deal should probably be
on gulf energy / bigcowboy . the producer , as i understand it , is acock
production , however , i may be mis - informed . any insight which any of you can
shed on this deal would be very welcome , i would like to capture this
accurately and definitively as early on as possible , so as to prevent any
future issues .
thank you all for your patience and assistance ,

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .
thanks

a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you
on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get
in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we
are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .
regards ,
brian

it is my understanding the outages valero incurred at the above locations are
force majure situations during december and should not trigger the buyback
feature of the contract .
gary , i have not seen any documentation of this from valero . please follow up
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to
process the deal as if the buyback is active .

donald ,
back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .

having discussed the matter with brian riley , hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big

this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been
pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes
have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom
and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and
determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im

we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu
tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective

now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search
yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review
of the two systems .
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,
both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca
adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .
the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in
sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel
quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .
after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have
said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and
are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its
oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm
has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored
comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find
totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular
( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s
no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you
buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying
in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up
loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .
this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my
cancelling xm .
xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept
xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no
matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered
everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the
talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the
useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius
also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .
however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all
have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for
the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows ."

spam,"Subject: dear friend ,
dear friend ,
i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe .
this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the
interest of the country .
it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum .
i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you .
all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets .
there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country .
we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers .
i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction .
i shall furnish you with more details on request .
yours truly

sherlyn ,
the pops meters 7107 , 7108 , and 7109 need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on unit gas pipeline . you will need daren or michael at enron to do the following
add meters 7107 , 7108 and 7109 on unit pipeline to sitara deals 70550
70549
70119
then you can run the pops 53 report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on unit pipeline .
once this is done , let me know and i will zero out the pops meters .

george ,
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow .
thanks

pat dresner ( accountant ) at midcon texas says she does not show these deals
in her system and she can not pay on them . you created the deals in sitara
and i don ' t have another trader ' s name . could you please talk to your kn
trader regarding this situation ? if midcon really got this gas , then someone
at kn should tell their accountant about the deal .

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data "" cleaned / scrubbed "" week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months "" active "" at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n ."

ham,"Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising
it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s
juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday ,
november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the
board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for
this year ' s fundraising efforts .
as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself .
even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of
complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it
they would die .
enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money
raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise
$ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team
leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the
walk this year is "" knock out diabetes "" and we would like to have you join us
for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it .
if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if
you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee
members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included
in the first important and informative training session taking place this

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .

yes , the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from williams . i will take the credit with our payment to williams on the 25 th . tenaska will send us their wire to us on the 24 th . i will make sure we receive the wire from tenaska before i send the wire to williams . i will also let james know about the volume for the agency fee . i thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume , not the nominated volume .

i have changed the demand fee . but , is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams ? i don ' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams . additionally , i believe that we need to keep the volume at 45 , 000 for the admin fee , since we originally nominated 45 , 000 / day .

ham,"Subject: organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets
as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to
announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer
- philippe bibi : chief technology officer
jeff , louise and philippe , along with greg whalley , will comprise the office
of the chairman for enron net works .
with jeff shankman  , s departure from enron north america  , s natural gas
operation , all of jeff  , s direct reports will report to john lavorato .
we are also pleased to announce the following changes to the enron north
america office of the chairman . john lavorato will join the ena office of
the chairman as chief operating officer . dave delainey will assume the role
of president and chief executive officer . mark frevert will retain his role

due to low volumes flowing from fuels cotton valley ,
we nominate 32 , 000 mmbtu / d at the hpl / eastrans interconnect
for the referenced period . we are estimating that will redeliver 7 , 000
mmbtu / d
from fuels cotton valley and 25 , 000 mmbtu / d into pg & e .
i talked to darren and brian on the ability to swing additional volume to pg
& e
during a day ,
and they said pg & e won ' t accept daily changes at all ! ! ! so , if that is the
case ,
we will have to find an alternate method to swing the volume . based on our
agreement ,
we have the ability to give them volume into other pipelines at the hub .
maybe
we
can swing on them . in the short term , however , we are going to have to make
due
with adjusting
the hpl volume to equal redelivered volume as best we can .
sorry for the lateness of this email . i will get daily nom changes into you
earlier next week .
thanks for working with us ."

seems prayer still upsets some people .
when minister joe wright was asked to open the new
session of the kansas senate , everyone was expecting
the usual generalities , but this is what they heard :
"" heavenly father , we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance .
we know your word says , "" woe to those who call evil
good "" , but that is exactly what we have done .
we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values . we confess that .
we have ridiculed the absolute truth of your word and
called it pluralism .
we have exploited the poor and called it the lottery ,
we have rewarded laziness and called it welfare ,
we have killed our unborn and called it choice ,
we have shot abortionists and called it justifiable ,
we have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self - esteem ,
we have abused power and called it politics ,
we have coveted our neighbor ' s possessions and called
it ambition ,
we have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement ,
we have ridiculed the time - honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment .
search us , oh , god , and know our hearts today ; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free . guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of your son , the living savior , jesus
christ . "" amen . ! ! ""
the response was immediate . a number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest . in 6 short
weeks , central christian church , where rev . wright is
pastor , logged more than 5 , 000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively . the church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from india , africa , and korea .
commentator paul harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program , "" the rest of the story "" , and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired . with the lord ' s help , may this prayer
sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our
desire so that we again can be called , "" one nation
under god . "" if possible , please pass this prayer on
to your friends . think about this : if you forward
this prayer to everyone on your email list in less
than 30 days it would be heard by the world .

subject : spinnaker - supply verification 11958 su - october 2000 production
gary ,
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month . since spinnaker was paid gas
daily pricing for the month , there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we
are going to owe spinnaker an additional
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .
one issue that needs to be addressed is this : should the additional money go
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration ?
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :
thank you all ! !

daren ,
sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .

to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on

2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during

one was not located .

via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

mike ,
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .

ham,"Subject: neon retreat
ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let
me what you think .

rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good . : )

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting

darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all ."

as you are aware , we are starting to collect data for our february price
model . i ' ve attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be
driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams . please
select your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for
the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver survey
with february numbers for your rc by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if your
group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data ,
please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list beginning
next month . this will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every
month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone within
your team beginning next month , please let me know .
please take this opportunity to verify the following :
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to
perform these activities for each commercial team .
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified
( please let us know otherwise )
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example "" allocate 0469 "" or
"" 80 - 20 split "" ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new
allocation is ) .
in reference to these surveys , please note :
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly
among these teams .
the costs for "" commercial team specific "" activities that you filled time out
for in the january time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial
team ( e . g . genco support will trace 100 % of its costs to genco ) .
please let us know if you have any questions on this survey .

i have felt a renewed heart for god , a fresh spirit . i have been in the word lately and doug and i have to committed to prayer time together each morning . it has brought a more positive attitude , much joy , and thankfulness on my part . and , yes , satan has already tried to steal that joy . but he will not prevail , i will not let him . so in those times when i feel that any bit of joy is seeping away , i begin to pray . i found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well . please read it , it may just jumpstart your day and you ' ll be filled with joy . have a great day ! amber
please take a moment to relax your mind and

this morning . i ' m blessed because you are a
forgiving god and an
understanding god . you have done so much for me
and you keep on blessing me .
forgive me this day for everything i have done ,
said or thought that was not
pleasing to you . i ask now for your forgiveness .
please keep me safe from all danger and harm .
help me to start this day
with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude . let
me make the best of each
and every day to clear my mind so that i can hear
from you .
please broaden my mind that i can accept all
things . let me not whine and
whimper over things i have no control over . let
me continue to see sin
through god ' s eyes and acknowledge it as evil .
and when i sin , let me
repent , and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing ,
and receive the forgiveness
of god .
and when this world closes in on me , let me
remember jesus ' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to pray . it ' s
the best response when i ' m
pushed beyond my limits . i know that when i can ' t
pray , you listen to my heart . continue to use me to do
your will . ? continue to bless me that i may
be a blessing to others .
keep me strong that i may help the weak . keep me
uplifted that i may have
words of encouragement for others . i pray for
those that are lost and can ' t
find their way .
i pray for those that are misjudged and
misunderstood . i pray for those who
don ' t know you intimately . i pray for those that
will delete this without
sharing it with others . i pray for those that
don ' t believe . but i thank
you that i believe .
i believe that god changes people and god changes
things . i pray for all my sisters and brothers . for each
and every family member in their households .
i pray for peace , love and joy in their homes
that they are out of debt and all their needs are met .
i pray that every eye that reads this knows there
is no problem , circumstance , or situation greater than god .
every battle is in your hands for you to fight . i pray that
these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees
them and every mouth that confesses them willingly .

just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .

subject : re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

darren ,
how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .
