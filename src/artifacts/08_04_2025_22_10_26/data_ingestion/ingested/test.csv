ham,"Subject: enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .

therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period

ham,"Subject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is

problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up

only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the

booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to

ham,"Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy
today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .
investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ; or investor relations , enron corp . , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3002 .

suspense account in one of the prime banks here in

ham,"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;

- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and

restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999

tradestar
corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing
on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have
followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have
profited nicely . the company tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior
oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset
drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have "" the largest untapped
potential for natural gas in north america . "" new prices and technologies have
exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over
90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil
and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south
of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in
economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease
values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from
several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total
output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset
wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas
@ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6
months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again !
using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to
tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most
prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! !
withabalanced portfolioofoilgas
properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign ,
experienced management team , and application of cutting edge
ep technologies , we believe that
tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment
portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a
company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy
prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to
bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk
to the company ! ! ! !
previous news

project
hot springs , ark . , - - tradestar
( otc : tirr ) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture
agreement with united production and exploration of houston , texas to reenter
and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county , texas . in
addition to the gas well reentry , the prospect , which covers 111 acres , has an
additional location to drill a new well . the objective formation of the
recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of
approximately 4 , 830 ' to 5 , 030 ' with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone .
estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750 , 000 mcf for each well .
why
we love this stockl . continued

prices ! 2 . over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific
barnett shale of central texas 3 . strong industry investment banking
relationships 4 . strong management - over
50 years of experience in the oil
patch 5 . multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners
6 . tight float ,
low entry price strong upward potential ! 7 .
business model offers only
real solution to u . s . dependency on foreign oil .
8 . the company recently proposed a "" joint venture
project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with
est . reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas !
conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major
presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential
for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the
barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward
movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take
the petroleum industryby storm . the company ' s resource development
is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in
the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last
year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

price for waha . wtx . if . m . i . . for 5 / 00 production . the deal # is 250237 .
i looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $ 2 . 95 .
the price of $ 2 . 95 plus $ 1 would equal the price of $ 2 . 96 which is what duke
is
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $ 3 . 95 .

elizabeth ,
i have a pricing discrepancy and i was not sure if i send this to you or
oneil .
it ' s for duke energy , 5 / 00 production , deal # 250237 . duke believes our
price is too high . the system downloaded a price of $ 3 . 95
the price should be waha . wtx . if . m . i . , which is $ 2 . 95 for that month . (
waha . wtx . if . m . i . + 1 ) duke believes we should have paid them $ 2 . 96 .
i think the system pulled in the wrong price . could you please let me know
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else ?
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )"

we need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv . i
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand
fee for feb 2001 for $ 29 , 851 . 64 , so i think we just need to change that to
the new amount . let me know if you want to handle this differently .

vance ,
the issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system , per
cheryl jones , effective 2 / 00 . therefore , any purchases at that point , for
02 / 00 forward , are ua 4 and are probably having a negative impact on your
accrual . i think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level ?
there have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination , so , i
don ' t know where exactly the term calpine deal is , physically . your
assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated .

subject : hpl optimization
team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .
regards ,
brian"
ham,"Subject: re : duke exchange deal feb . 2000 prod .
daren ,
i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example # 1 .
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .
i have attached my spreadsheet for support :
the most current worksheet is tab # 2 marked final
column g is the over - delivery quantity total is 17 , 278 mmbtus
column s is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due hplc
$ 1 , 008 . 87
column t is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due the
customer $ 519 . 73 .

katherine ,
there are 2 ways that i can enter this fee into sitara :
1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i
can ' t just input a dollar amount in sitara .
let me know how you want to handle it .

ham,"Subject: re : fuel
application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a
total basis .

we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get
the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the
downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?"

the new sitara to unify bridge monitor is in production .
the monitor shows deals in error state ( failed ) or in queue to bridge

you will find it under - start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge
monitor .
you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not
already loaded .
we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .

state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .

i contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday .
however , i know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to
you ) .
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need ,
and for putting up with the "" outlaws "" . in addition to our friendship , i

sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )

general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager ."

ami ,
sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of
implementing sap ( which i ' m sure
you have heard about ) , and haven ' t had time to put the sample report
together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he
will be getting back with you on this ."

subject : unify performance problem on wednesday
as you are aware , the unify system experienced significant performance
problems wednesday from approx 9 : 30 am - 11 : 20 am . the duration of the
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before .
the problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking
that a fresh login might work better . additional logins never improve
performance and generally degrade it , but that is another story . ( there was
actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to "" bounce "" the server
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance .
the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a
particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in
the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have
contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the
behavior is a "" feature "" or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types
of changes at night during scheduled outages .
i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again .
if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a
call .

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

ham,"Subject: tenaska iv agency fee
can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 .
my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further .

i know you ' re busy with bid week , so here are a couple questions & comments
for you :
september
i need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
of the williams & apache gas . we still only the supply is in mops . if it
just needs points added to it , just let me know the deal ticket # .
august 31 st
this was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
lonestar 1023 & 1460 . currently , they do not have the supply points needed
for the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
imbalance . . . so i will get them added so this gas can be pathed .
july 31 - aug 7
these days were pathed as buy / sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
ventures .
i worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment ( july &
aug business ) , and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st .
please let me know what you think when you get a chance .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

spam,"Subject: next of kin
attn ; dear sir / madam .
i am mr . michael fisher , in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance department of barclay ' s bank .
i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co - operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department . we discovered an unclaimed sum of  24 . 5 million ( twenty - four million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account belonging to one of our customer , who died in a car crash with the entire family in year 2001 .
since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money . unfortunately , neither the family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money . we cannot release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or relation to the deceased .
our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed for a period of four ( 4 ) years , it would be transferred into barclay ' s bank treasury as unclaimed fund . another officer and i in the department now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this money to go back into the bank treasury as the unclaimed debt . in fact it is my friend that advised me to urgently arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary outside the country .
we have decided to give you 20 % of the total sum . so please , as a matter of urgency send to me your telephone and fax numbers for effective communication . i will do my best to see that we conclude this transaction successfully on time .
please if you are interested send me an immediate mail so that i can explain the details to you , so you could understand everything about this business waiting for your urgent response .
thank you .

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

spam,"Subject: from mrs . juliana
dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku

just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .
- - - - - original message - - - - -
from : hull , bryan
sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am
to : redmond , brian
subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) ."

ham,"Subject: williams energy marketing
i have a request from the ena settlements group . williams energy is billing
the hpl purchase deals on the ena invoice . the accountant at williams says ,
that by the request of the hpl trader , the deals are to be billed to ena . we
would like to have the texas deals billed directly to hpl . if you do not
have a problem with this , can you ask your counterpart at williams to split
the deals between hpl and ena ? it would make the payment process much easier .
thanks ,

ham,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

per conversation with rosa brown and thu ( in volumes management , beaumont
methanol is a swing deal , by which the gas sales allocations are handled by
the scheduletr . thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428 .
do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter # 981428 ? if so , can
you confirm 02 - 01 sales ( on hpl , meter # 981428 . , sales deal # 603107 ) , to
beaumont methanol ( which we  , ve invoiced them ) , vs . chyral hankins  , e - mial to

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?
darren
do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct ?

i reviewed the gas deals on franks ' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in sitara . as soon as i have the october gas numbers , i will forward them to you .
attached is a spreadsheet of the tglo deals booked to the gl to help you with our current settlement position . it is divided by debit / credit entries . when the sales are booked , a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account ( 40004000 third party ; 40005000 intercompany ) for the profit center .
below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to egm . i have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book aug and sept crude . i will wait for the go ahead from frank before i final them to the gl . let me know if you have any questions .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

arre you saying that for both days that two ( 2 ) ena contracts should be
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the
total volume to each contract ?

subject : re : enerfin meter 980439 for 10 / 00
jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

jackie ,
your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because
we have tiered pricing this month .
thanks ."

ham,"Subject: cox exploration
darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all ."

i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from

have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .
for example , we originally sold 10 , 000 mmbtu on 8 / 3 / 99 to txu and purchased
1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows

piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal ?

hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

ham,"Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans ."

i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with
hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,
can hpl sever the point some other way ?
someone let me hear what you think .

their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their

subject : special prayer request
hi ,
i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some good
friends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year old
baby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark was
diagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . he
also has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .
if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live to
july . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at the
anderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows of
a
strong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( when
possible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if a
donor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .
it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers and
i
know if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .
if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every little
prayer they get will be appreciated .
thank you !

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
10 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid

any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ gd hsc high

rita , please help me with this . i have some questions regarding enerfin .
why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
original numbers back in october ? can ' t this be fixed in the actualization
process ?
the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
these small volumes to handle this ? we go round and round at this point
changing volumes two , three or more times . call me if you have questions . .

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

face it . little stocks can mean big gains for you . this report is
part of a large pr campaign on this stock .
about the company :
the primary objective of hpng is to participate in specialty finance
within the public and private markets . hampden has partnerships
with finance and in surance companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short - term financing .
hampden is a unique finance company that uses new technologies to
help track and protect loan portfolio assets . the use of
sophisticated tracking technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and allows the company to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments . in addition to physical
asset backed lending , hampden grp . will also actively participate
in structured financial contracts with small public companies
through pipe ( private investment public entity ) transactions .
hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short - term working capital and cannot obtain
traditional financing .
hampden ' s business plan provides collateralized financing to
its customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25 % . the
company ' s valuation , financial ratios , executive compensation , exit
strategy , and other management decisions are driven directly from
the business plan . ( source : news announcement 10 / 15 / 04 )
will hpng explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until it is too
late . remember , timing your trade is critical . good luck and happy
trading .

lauri ,
effective 3 / 1 / 2001 , hplc amended its contract with royal production changing the price to 100 % hsc less $ 0 . 16 and extending the term through 2 / 28 / 02 . consequently , for march , hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at meter 5310 . effective april , hplc amended the same contract releasing the l . g . talbert # 2 lease in the committed reserves agreement ; mike morris is the gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu / d . for april i nom 1132 / d ; bob , we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental production at this point .
thanks ,

louis cox with copano ( the interconnecting party at this meter ) informed me that effective march lst , we should have been buying incremental gas from royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to copano . there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this point , however . this point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow i have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th . bob / vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should be ? copano says they ' re not getting the gas in april either , but they do not know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal . please let me know what the resolution is . thanks ."

ham,"Subject: fw : 30 th floor after move
i need the following . . . . . . . .
assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to it connection issues or problems with the building itself ( ac , power , etc . ) . if we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30 th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side . obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely . one approach is to take the edi pipes and have them go to the 30 th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home . using this approach , and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30 th floor . i ' m open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them . i need this by friday 7 / 27 no later than noon .

during the first six months after the move to the new building , it has recommended that the 30 th floor be maintained in case of any emergency .
what we have to do is come up with the list of critical personnel . there will be very limited seating ,
these should be just the people to finish the day when ever that happens .
let ' s get together tomorrow and discuss .

daren :
during the month of september and october 2000 , gas flowed into hpl ' s
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
marketing , llc . prior to september 2000 , the gas was purchased under
contract # 960439646 , and deal # 133196 that expired on 8 / 31 / 2000 . effective
11 / 1 / 2000 , the gas was again purchased from duke under contract # 96021934 ;
deal # 466305 , but this deal expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 .
currently , logistic has september and october 2000 volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract . in order to correct this , hpl logistics needs either
( 1 ) deals # 133196 or # 466305 extended to cover september and october 2000 ,
( 2 ) a new deal to cover september and october 2000 , or ( 3 ) logistics needs
approval to write - off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss . ( print ,
sign , and return the original to clem cernosek ) .
deal / deal ticket # / customer ( buyer / seller )
or
approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
in addition , since deal # 466305 expires on 11 / 30 / 2000 and gas is still
flowing , logistics needs either ( 1 ) deal # 466305 extended , or ( 2 ) a new deal
to cover december 2000 and any other future months that this production is
flowing into hpl ' s pipeline .

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan
i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced .
our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go
i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service .
the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them .
a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us .
death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep .
rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time .
listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune .
getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail .
the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication .
our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .

the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .

ham,"Subject: memo from office of the chair
the mid - year performance management cycle will begin on may 15 with the
opening of the pep system ( the online "" performance evaluation process ""
feedback system ) . you will be receiving your password for this system in a
note to go out later from pep . in preparation for the cycle , four training
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who have
not previously attended training . enrollment for these classes will be
offered through the development center "" ernie "" system . for employees who are
outside the houston area , please contact your hr representative for more
information .
these sessions will be held on :
wednesday , may 10 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . , and three sessions to be held on
thursday , may 11 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . ; 1 : 30 - 2 : 30 p . m . ; and 3 : 00 - 4 : 00 p . m .
all sessions will be held at the doubletree hotel .
to register , click on this link to go directly to the development center
for those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar
with the past performance management process , there have been some
modifications :
1 . the performance management process is now enron wide . all enron feedback
forms have been reduced to three ( vice president ( vp ) / managing director
( md ) ; management / professional ; and administration / support ) , which all use
the following criteria :
? innovation / entrepreneurship
? communication / setting direction
? teamwork / interpersonal
? leadership / vision / values
? business instinct
? analytical / technical
2 . the following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the
final feedback forms across enron :
superior
excellent
strong
satisfactory
needs improvement
issues
3 . there will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purposes
of the prc ( formerly the business review meetings ) meeting .
? commercial
? commercial support
? technical
? specialized technical
4 . the performance review process will continue to be used to facilitate :
? promotions - up to director level only . there will be no officer promotions
to vp / md at mid - year
? feedback to employee
? compensation decisions
? sharing of performance rating at manager  , s discretion
5 . prc meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships .
functional prc meetings will take place first , followed by the final business
unit meetings . difference in views on an individual employee  , s rating should
be discussed and consensus should be reached . the functional area meetings
are :
- accounting
- human resources
- government affairs
- rac
- global finance
6 . the pep system is now available via the intranet to allow greater access
from global locations and remotely . the functionality is essentially the
same . if you would like further information on how to use this system you may
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking on the attached
weblinkhttp : / / home . enron . com / announce / . pdf . if the
quick reference does not display correctly on your pc , call your help desk
for assistance , or irma alvarez at 713 - 853 - 1543 to get a hard copy .
7 . the general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall
process :
employee / reviewer responsibilities :
select 5 - 7 reviewers
complete self - assessment
complete requested feedback forms
reviewers who cannot provide feedback use the decline request feature
supervisor responsibilities :
approve reviewers ( at least 3 of the employee ' s choices )
communicate modifications to employee
participate in prc meetings as required
summarize feedback and complete appropriate feedback form
communicate feedback to the employee
schedule for mid - year performance review
may 15 pep system opens for feedback
june 9 pep system closes for feedback
june 12 functional / business unit prc meetings begin
july 20 prc meetings should finish
july 31 / august 1 vp & md prc meeting
as always , if you have further questions on the performance management
process , you may contact your hr representative ."

businesses like enron broadband services and enron net works , and it is
responsible for applications such as enrononline and enroncredit . com . you  , ve
seen what technology can do at work . now we want you and your family to
realize its benefits at home .

the computer hardware . we wanted to let you know about the program now in
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home
computer or internet connection in the next few months . the scope of
clickathome includes the following :

the problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly
in sitara . for january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas
from gmt company inc , not gmt inc . someone needs to either correct the deal
for 1 / 00 or put in a new deal , then i can do an accounting arrangement to
make the necessary correction . it is correct for 2 / 00 on deal 156292 . i
emailed daren on this because i see his name in sitara as the contact , but i

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont . go for it .
as a precaution , we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious .
once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt
and limit him to this one well . otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
them all through this new meter ."

ham,"Subject: re : big cowboy for august
mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .

beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :

big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less

to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make

logistics has these volumes recorded to hpl stranger gas contract . in order
to correct this , hpl logistics needs either a new deal to record these

ham,"Subject: tenaska iv 11 / 00
i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .
1 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 1 demand fee from $ 341 , 250 . 47 to $ 493 , 365 . 74
( difference $ 152 , 115 . 27 )
2 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 2 demand fee from $ 167 , 062 . 50 to $ 159 , 721 . 55
( difference $ 7 , 340 . 95 )
3 . deal 514353 - change agency fee volume from 45 , 000 / day to 45 , 016 / day

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron

ham,"Subject: zero path termination in path manager
matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

ham,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

nomad international inc . ( ndin )
a multi - national internet communications company developing cost
effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip )
technologies .

current price : o . 08
will it continue higher ? watch this one monday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which
includes bermuda .
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s
market as soon as practicably possible .
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive
to the caribbean market .
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
about nomad international inc .
nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications
company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,
cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on
targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,
2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european
presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in
their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more
economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their
relatives in their country of origin .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal ."

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for

would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .

have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda

the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

subject : june transport usage tickets
i updated the june transport usage tickets today through hpl , and will be
finishing these tickets tomorrow . rates have been updated to reflect current
matrix rates and all baseload rates that i know of at this time . i have not
yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let
me know . also , i have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june , so
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you
have any questions . all pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning .

position the organization for the remainder of 2000 and in response to ray

and will have a high level of involvement in existing portfolio investments
and will work closely with ena treasury and the various origination groups to
assure that new transactions ( a ) incorporate appropriate risk / return
characteristics , ( b ) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing
signals , and ( c ) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes
syndication of the investment , if applicable , and a specific exit strategy .
portfolio management includes restructuring / special assets ( randy
maffett / dick lydecker ) and capital structuring ( andrea reed ) . steve pruett
( energy capital resources ) , chuck ward ( generation investments ) , don miller
( merchant generation ) , and chris helfrich ( coal and industrial ) will continue

now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bull market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to expiore further opportunities in aiberta canada , a is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating potential of miliions per week
symbol - mogi
price - . 47
increased 11 % last three day ,

how much it wi | | up again ?
the vaiue of mogi ' s shares wil | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - mi | | ions , mogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . montana oil and gas speciaiizes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and developers | ike montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns .
vancouver , march 11 , 2 oo 5 - ( mogi ) president peter sanders would | ike to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the alberta canada region where the company currentiy has interests in three projects . the company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in , or acquire | eases , which may include producing welis and or expioratory programs which wi | | strengthen montana  s position with energy , cash oriented investment banking groups .
one of the most effective ways to acquire financia | partners for drilling programs invoives existing production of oil and or gas in these programs . this wiil significantiy lessens the risk for the investment group , hence encouraging financial participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment group .
the sylvan lake project will begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a driiling rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted . the rig is currentiy sitting in red deer aiberta a mere 30 miles from syivan lake . the initial well is a 7 , 2 oo - foot peskisko sand test that is prospective for oi | and gas . it is expected to take approximateiy 10 to 12 days to dril | and test the initia | wel | . each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 15 o barreis of oil per day and 75 o miilion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 biilion cubic feet gas and 3 oo , 0 oo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average wel | in the syivan lake fieid has produced 50 o barrels of oi | per day with over one mi | | ion cubic feet of gas per day . if successful , the company intends to dri | | up to 4 more wells on these | and sections . for more detaiied information on this project please see news reiease dated feb . 7 th , 2 oo 5 . an announcement wiil be made immediateiy upon the commencement of driiling .
the company is aiso pieased to report that the tie in of its west lock project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this will be complete some time in the next couple of days . peter sanders notes  the compietion and tie in of the west lock project has ran into numerous delays , however , this wel | wil | be tied in and the company wil | be se | | ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company  the company wi | | update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion .
wi | | mogi expiode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait unti | it is too late .
remember , timing your trade is critica | .
good luck and successfu | trading .

subject : gorons
don ' t know who you ' re voting for , but here some things you might want to
consider -
what is a goron
1 . gorons sincerely believe that vice president gore is a true
environmentalist , when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm :
a polluting zinc mine , from which he received $ 500 , 000 of income last
year .
2 . gorons likewise believe that the vp is antismoking and anti - tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies .
3 . gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact
he was placed by family influence in a "" cushy "" correspondent ' s job and
the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera ! ( and his bong )
4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the
vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .
5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums
of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .
6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "" invent the
internet "" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially incriminating e - mail !
7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were
the models for the book and movie , "" love story "" even though the book ' s
author , erich segal , says not .
8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s
champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million
dollars in occidental petroleum stock .
9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president
clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain
silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton "" one of
the greatest presidents of our history . ""
10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they
won ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so
ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of
tennessee ' s senators !
11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum house that he was renting to them .
cautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are
generally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there ,
unfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to
actually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their
ailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and
that of the usa .
therefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to
aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to
your normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate
treatment ."

jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,

mike ,
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

ham,"Subject: enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business
opportunity ."

volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for august 2000 and provide
explanations for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year ,

a volume of 6 , 289 mmbtu flowed over the noms for cp & l . i don ' t have a record of a spot deal with them for that day .
gary - currently , that volume has been allocated to the term agreement . the price difference on that day is significant . ( hsc gd mid was 5 . 245 ) . if you don ' t have a record of a spot deal , the allocation should stand as it is .

subject : resume for summer internship
april 20 , 2000
dear mr . mcconnell :
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron . i understand that you have spoken to my father , scott
wells at texaco , and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one .
i ' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer .
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry . i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler , and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline . this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points .
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning . throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor . it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron .
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility . i will be available to have a start date of

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

ham,"Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

for immediate release

espn to launch sidelines network ' s second reality - based series to
premiere with texas a & m football
espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
"" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , "" texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . "" we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . ""
in a "" docu - drama "" style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
"" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , "" head coach r . c . slocum said . "" we look forward to working
with
them . ""
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
"" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , ""
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . "" sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . ""
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase "" 12 th man "" and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a ""
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all
platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio

it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .

ham,"Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 . - followup
here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .

then i will get to it asap ."

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .
before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .
it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .
i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .
thank for your anticipated co - operations .
peter stevens .

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play "" capture the flag "" . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around

please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of
your favorites .
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .
attached is the url for user to run the application .
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the
application .
here is the steps they should do :
1 ) launch internet explorer
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and
click on above url )
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names
into the group .
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .
4 ) click on "" comments "" button to add messages : there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "" comments "" button . there are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box :
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or
( 2 ) click on "" send "" button to send the message .
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages .
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .
note : right now the application is under test environment . if they like it , i
will move it into production environment soon .
let me know any feedbacks .
thanks ,

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
